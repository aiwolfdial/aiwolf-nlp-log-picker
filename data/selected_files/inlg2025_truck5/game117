1,talk,0,0,1, I divined Jonathan last night and the result showed he's a Werewolf We need to discuss this and decide our next steps
1,talk,1,0,2,To be clear. I divined Midori last night. The divination result shows they are a Werewolf. We must be cautious and share thoughts.
1,talk,2,0,3,I divined Midori last night and they are a Werewolf. We need to act on this info!
1,talk,3,0,5,A 3-CO confirms Sakura and I are villagers. Midori's claim against me is false. Vote Midori.
1,talk,4,0,4,...
1,talk,5,1,1,I need to retract my previous claim of being the Seer I'm actually a Villager I wanted to draw out reactions from potential Werewolves
1,talk,6,1,2,To be clear. Jonathan claiming seer is risky among villagers. If his claims hold. I suspect Midori is more likely a werewolf.
1,talk,7,1,3,Midori's retraction is suspicious. I trust my divination; let's vote Midori.
1,talk,8,1,5,The 3 claims confirm the non-claimants are human. Midori's claim is objectively false. Vote accordingly.
1,talk,9,1,4,...
1,talk,10,2,1,It seems there are conflicting statements Let's vote for Jonathan to remove potential danger to the village.
1,talk,11,2,2,To be clear. Midori lied about being Seer. Mr. Jonathan I notice your claim against Midori. Why should we vote them off first?
1,talk,12,2,3,Minako I trust my divination of Midori. Let's focus on the confirmed Werewolf first.
1,talk,13,2,5,The data is conclusive. Further debate is a waste of time. My vote is for Midori.
1,talk,14,2,4,...
1,talk,15,3,1,Let's vote for Jonathan to ensure village safety.
1,talk,16,3,2,To be clear. Choosing not to vote for Midori endangers the village. This abrupt retraction suggests werewolf deceit. Stay vigilant.
1,talk,17,3,3,Let's stay united and vote Midori. We need to ensure village safety by acting now.
