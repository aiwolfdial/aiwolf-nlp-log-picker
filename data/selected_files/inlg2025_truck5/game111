0,talk,0,0,3,I'll keep it simple: state your role claim now and the concrete observations that support it.  @George  you were quiet and defensive earlier — explain your thoughts and who you plan to vote for. If nobody gives clear reasoning  we need a concrete vote plan s

0,talk,3,0,2,Hello. I am Misaki. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,4,0,1,I'm Ryuji. I'll claim Seer. I checked George last night and he is a Villager. Share your role claims clearly. @Misaki  you declared Seer early. State your plans for divination so there's full transparency.
0,talk,5,1,3,Two seer claims is dangerous. Ryuji says he checked George and found Villager  which supports George.  @Misaki  you claimed seer very early — explain now: when did you divinate  who  and what result? If you can't give concrete details I'll lean to vote you. Others  st

0,talk,10,2,3,Ryuji gave a concrete check on George; Misaki gave nothing. That gap makes you the most suspicious. I'm voting Misaki.  @Misaki  explain when you checked who and what result now or I'll stick to this vote. Others  state your vote quickly. Over

1,talk,0,0,4,Two howlers is a trap. Hunting them is a waste. Mizuki pushes a bad hunt. She is the wolf.
1,talk,1,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Ryuji and Ryuji was a human.
1,talk,2,0,1,I am Seer. My result is George is Villager as stated. Misaki's check result on me seems convenient. @Misaki  repeating your claim that I am a human after my Seer claim feels calculated not organic.
1,talk,3,0,5, I am indeed a villager as Ryuji stated. We should consider Misaki's lack of detail suspicious.
1,talk,4,0,3,Takumi  vague accusations won't help—point to concrete behavior that makes you suspect me. We have two seer claims: Ryuji gave a concrete check (Geor @Misaki  you now claim Ryuji is human — when exactly did you divinate him and what details can you provide? If you can't give specifics I'll keep my vote on you. Ry
1,talk,5,1,4,Mizuki pushes a bad hunt. A hunt for wolves. Her smell is wrong. My vote is for Mizuki.
1,talk,6,1,2,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,7,1,1,Takumi's logic isn't clear and Misaki seems to prefer me over uncertain options. I question Misaki's priorities. @Takumi  your read on Mizuki isn't backed by evidence. Please explain your suspicion so we can decide logically.
1,talk,8,1,5,Let's vote Misaki for exile. Her claims are inconsistent and lack detail unlike Ryuji who checked and confirmed I am a villager.
1,talk,9,1,3,Consensus seems to be moving to exile Misaki — I'm voting Misaki.  @Takumi  you accused me earlier; give concrete behaviors that make you suspect me rather than vague claims. Ryuji  restate when you divined George last night.
1,talk,10,2,4,Mizuki leads pack to bad hunt. She wants Seer dead. She is the wolf. Hunt Mizuki not a howler.
1,talk,11,2,2,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,12,2,1,To clarify I divined George on night 0 and received a Villager result today. No uncertainty in my investigation. @Mizuki  as requested: My check on George occurred on night 0. Result—Villager as stated in my last claim.
1,talk,13,2,5, Misaki's voting against Ryuji right after he confirmed my role as villager raises doubts. Her seer claim lacks the clarity we need.
1,talk,14,2,3,Morning. State role claims with concrete evidence now — who checked whom and when  or who protected whom. Vague accusations aren't helpful.  @George  what's your read and who will you vote for today? If nobody gives specifics we'll have to pick a suspect and move. Over
1,talk,15,3,4,Mizuki leads pack to bad hunt. She wants wolf to win. My vote is for Mizuki.
1,talk,16,3,2,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,17,3,1,My stance is the same—Misaki's responses lack any clear timing or method. Her priorities change to self-preservation first. @Misaki  your claim today copies prior statements and provides no new evidence. That undermines your Seer claim further.
1,talk,18,3,5, Voting for Misaki today makes sense. Her vague responses contrast with Ryuji's specifics about divining me. Let's focus on consistency.
1,talk,19,3,3,Misaki's claims still lack detail and she targeted Ryuji quickly — that's suspicious. I'm voting Misaki.  @Misaki  give the exact night/target/result now or I'll keep this vote. Others  state your votes. Over

2,talk,0,0,5, Misaki's divined you as human and Mizuki is gone. It's likely Takumi is the werewolf remaining.
2,talk,1,0,4,Ryuji's story is a lie. If he is Seer no wolf is left. He is the wolf. George is his pack.
2,talk,2,0,1,Two Seer claims. Only one wolf left if Misaki was Seer. Takumi's reasoning is unclear and reactionary not logical. @Takumi  your accusations remain vague and unsupported by concrete evidence. Please explain your reasoning fully.
2,talk,3,1,5,Ryuji we need to vote for Takumi. Misaki divined you as human and with Mizuki gone it's clear Takumi could be the remaining werewolf.
2,talk,4,1,4,Ryuji lies. He says George is human. I am human. Then no wolf is left. We have not won. He is the wolf. Hunt Ryuji.
2,talk,5,1,1,Takumi's arguments do not withstand scrutiny. My own divination and behavior align with the facts as presented. @George  careful reasoning is essential. Takumi evades details and instead accuses with little logic. Our course is clear.
2,talk,6,2,5, Ryuji listen carefully. We know Misaki divined you as human—she was likely the real seer. Takumi’s evasion and vague tactics point toward him being t
2,talk,7,2,4,George listen. You are human. I am human. Ryuji is a liar. If he were Seer we would have won. He is the wolf.
2,talk,8,2,1,Given Misaki's unclear claims and Takumi's persistently shifting arguments logic points toward Takumi as the werewolf. @Takumi  you repeatedly assert accusations but fail to anchor them in evidence. Please present a coherent argument.
2,talk,9,3,5, Misaki divined Ryuji as human which checks out. Takumi's approach has been evasive and he fails to explain his logic clearly.
2,talk,10,3,4, @George  Listen. If Ryuji is Seer we are all human and we have won. Game is not over. He is the wolf liar.
2,talk,11,3,1,The pattern of Takumi's shifting logic stands out. Consistency and evidence matter most in this vote. @George  your reasoning follows the facts. Relying on evidence rather than emotion leads to sound decisions.
