0,talk,1,0,3,Let’s keep calm and observe carefully before judging anyone. Rash moves help the wolves—George speaks.
0,talk,2,0,5,Hello everyone! I'm Minako. Excited to play Werewolf with you all and see who's the craftiest! Let's have fun!
0,talk,3,0,2,Hi everyone I'm Victoria. Looking forward to unraveling the mystery with all of you.
0,talk,4,0,1,Good day everyone. I am simply a villager seeking truth. Let's move forward with patience and clarity. @Victoria  your approach resonates. May we observe quietly and find understanding amidst the noise.

1,talk,0,0,1,Morning everyone. I'm just a simple villager once more. Let's tread lightly and observe carefully. @George  your caution yesterday was admirable. Still have you noticed anything peculiar so far?
1,talk,1,0,4,Jonathan's saying he's a villager again huh? Isn't it a bit early for that buddy? Those cautious players might be hiding roles. Minako feels pretty ge
1,talk,2,0,2,Kenji your point about cautious players is intriguing. Let's keep our eyes open.
1,talk,3,0,5,I divined George last night. He’s Human. Let’s focus on others for suspicion.
1,talk,4,0,3, I checked Minako last night and she’s Human. Let’s focus on finding the wolf among the three others.
1,talk,5,1,1,So both Minako and George claim Seer each clearing the other. We may have a contest here. Let's hear more thoughts. @Victoria  you seem attuned to subtleties. Has anyone’s tone shifted for you since yesterday?
1,talk,6,1,4,Jonathan claims villager twice. Can Seers check him out next?  @Jonathan  So. Your double villager claim is kinda straightforward huh? Could you tell us why there's no change of heart?
1,talk,7,1,2,Jonathan your consistency is noted. Has anyone else caught your attention with their actions?
1,talk,8,1,5,Let's vote for Jonathan. His repeated insistence on being a simple villager raises doubt.
1,talk,9,1,3,Both Seer COs clearing each other means the wolf hides among Jonathan Kenji or Victoria. Let’s focus votes there.
1,talk,10,2,1,It seems suspicion falls my way for simplicity. Sometimes clarity invites doubt. I'll keep an open mind. @Kenji  I wish there was a cleverer reason—simplicity suits me that's all. Have you sensed anything unusual today?
1,talk,11,2,4,Hey pals let's think about divining Jonathan or Victoria next! They might be wolves or possessed. Curious to see what we find!
1,talk,12,2,2,Kenji divining could indeed be wise. Who do you personally suspect more?
1,talk,13,2,5,We should vote for Jonathan due to his repetitive and defensive stance on being a mere villager without contributing new information or suspicions.
1,talk,14,2,3, my divination shows Minako is Human. Let's focus on Jonathan Kenji Victoria for the wolf.
1,talk,15,3,1,I sense the tension growing yet I remain patient. Haste leads to shadows. Let us not cloud judgment with urgency. @Victoria  your questions stir reflection. Among us do you find sincerity or subtle masks forming?
1,talk,16,3,4,If George is the Seer then Minako looks shady. If Minako’s the Seer George is suspicious. Let's dive into this buddy. George did divination on Minako.
1,talk,17,3,2,Jonathan your patience is noted. I sense masks but clarity will emerge soon.
1,talk,18,3,5,I believe we should focus on voting out Jonathan. His unchanging position as a simple villager when tension rises could be a strategy to avoid detecti
1,talk,19,3,3,My divination clears Minako. After today’s talks Kenji’s shifting stance marks him as my prime suspect. I’m voting Kenji.

2,talk,0,0,2,George with Minako gone your insights are crucial. What’s your next move?
2,talk,1,0,3,I divined Kenji as Human last night. That leaves Jonathan and Victoria—one of you must be the wolf.
2,talk,2,0,1,George I hear your reasoning. With only a few of us left care is needed. Rushed judgment could end the village. @Victoria  you’ve asked important questions. How do you feel about George’s results and intentions now?
2,talk,3,1,2,Jonathan George's results are puzzling. We need more clarity before making a choice.
2,talk,4,1,3, @Jonathan  both Seers landed suspicion on you. Kenji was Human so you’re my clear suspect now. Explain your side.
2,talk,5,1,1,George suspicion is a heavy mantle. My words haven't changed—I seek only what's best for the village. @George  since both Seers cleared each other and Kenji why would the wolf act so openly now? Do you feel any doubt?
2,talk,6,2,2,George could there be a misunderstanding here? We must tread carefully.
2,talk,7,2,3, @Victoria  you always push caution not clarity. Why haven’t you named your prime suspect yet? Time for answers.
2,talk,8,2,1,In times like these a steady approach often serves better than quick accusations. Let’s not overlook subtle details. @Victoria  I sense your caution. What factors weigh most in your mind when you look at George’s actions?
2,talk,9,3,2,Jonathan I weigh George's consistency and his divinations. Let's consider all angles.
2,talk,10,3,3,Jonathan’s actions line up with what both Seers feared. Victoria time for conviction not caution. I vote Jonathan.
2,talk,11,3,1,George your certainty is notable. But absolute confidence can sometimes mask overlooked nuance. @Victoria  you reflect before judging. Whose behavior over these days strikes you as least aligned with the Village?
