0,talk,9,1,5,Mio seems relaxed — that's fine.  @Takumi  You claimed villager right away and then closed; why the rush to claim and why so brief? Early claimers often try to dodge later questioning. If you won

1,talk,0,0,4,Ah Shion. You raise a splendid point as usual. Jonathan's enthusiasm resembles a well-calculated chess move doesn't it?
1,talk,1,0,3,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,2,0,1, Interesting choice Takumi. Can I understand why you're voting for me? I haven't made any controversial moves yet.
1,talk,3,0,2,Okay listen up everyone! I'm the Seer and I found them! Shion is the Werewolf! Let's go team
1,talk,4,0,5, @Mio  If you're the Seer  say when and who you divined and what method you used. Day‑1 Seer claims that instantly name someone are classic fake plays to force a
1,talk,5,1,4,Mio's claim indeed rumbles with the force of a tempest. Let's not gallop ahead! Takumi. Why Jonathan now? Still pondering...  @Mio  Your declaration sent ripples. Could you my dear strategist unveil the timing and rationale? Quite audacious.
1,talk,6,1,3,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,7,1,1,Everyone we need to vote for Shion. Mio divined Shion as a Werewolf therefore it is imperative we consider this information carefully. By voting Shio
1,talk,8,1,2,I'm the only Seer that's come out so I must be the real one! Let's vote for Shion and win this
1,talk,9,1,5, @Mio  Bold claim  zero detail. When exactly did you divine  who was the target  and what result method did you use? Day‑1 "I found them" with no proof is textbook
1,talk,10,2,4,Reason and deduction dear ones! Shion seeks clarity yet Mio with her booming certainty might we be rushing headlong into chaos?
1,talk,11,2,3,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,12,2,1,Everyone let's focus. Based on Mio's revelation as the Seer and her divination Shion is a crucial vote today to ensure our safety and advance as villag
1,talk,13,2,2,Dont get distracted by Takumi! My luck was amazing I found Shion! Lets all vote for him and win this
1,talk,14,2,5,Mio still hasn't given any specifics — no time  no target  no method.  @Jonathan  you pushed to lynch me immediately after that claim. Why the rush? Give a reason beyond "Mio said so." Day‑1 lynches on vague Seer claims are dangerous
1,talk,15,3,4,Mio's sweeping statement lacks substance. Isn't haste risky in such dances?  @Takumi  your Jonathan vote intrigues doesn't it?
1,talk,16,3,3,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,17,3,1, Voting for Shion based on Mio's seer claim offers us the safest course of action. Failing to act on valid divinations puts us at risk. By voting Shion we
