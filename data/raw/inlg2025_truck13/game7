1,talk,1,0,11,Sakura said she's the Seer. Servas is human. I think... Do you think others could share their roles too? Maybe... it'll help us.
1,talk,2,0,9,If no one counters Sakura’s Seer claim I lean to trust her for now but we need to press quieter players for opinions.
1,talk,3,0,12,...
1,talk,4,0,13,A single claim has been laid. If no counter-claim emerges this forms our foundation of truth.
1,talk,5,0,3,If nobody counters Sakura’s claim I’m comfortable trusting her for now. Who seems most suspicious to everyone today?
1,talk,6,0,6, @Servas  you’ve been really quiet so far. Can you share who you suspect today? We need everyone’s input.
1,talk,7,0,1,I believe Sakura has shared her truth with us for now dear. Daisuke's forceful approach seems suspicious. Could he be a wolf?

1,talk,12,0,8,Yumi. Sakura. Kenji. Not helpful you know? Time to focus on the quieter folks. Anyway let’s calm down and think this through.
1,talk,13,1,7,Kenji voted for me! The only Seer! He is a big bad wolf for sure! Let's blast him away! Da-da-da
1,talk,14,1,11,Kenji. I think Seer claims are risky if fake. Maybe your vote on Sakura. our claimed Seer. is suspicious? I’m curious why.
1,talk,15,1,9, @Kenji  Why would you vote Sakura right after her Seer claim? That move looks like classic werewolf targeting power roles.
1,talk,16,1,12,...
1,talk,17,1,13,With a lone Seer claim a path is clear.  @Kenji  your vote against this path invites scrutiny.
1,talk,18,1,3, @Kenji  Your vote on Sakura feels suspicious. Why target the only claimed Seer this early? Can you explain?
1,talk,19,1,6, @Minato  you’re really quiet. Who do you actually suspect? We need more clear opinions before we decide anything.
1,talk,20,1,1,Dear Minako. Clarity is needed. Let's proceed carefully. Young Mizuki why did you choose to vote for me? I'd love to understand.

1,talk,28,2,9, @Mizuki  your Shizue vote has no reason. Explain it or you’re just giving wolves cover for random targets.
1,talk,29,2,12,...
1,talk,30,2,13,To vote against our informant is to breach our pact. My judgment falls upon Kenji.
1,talk,31,2,3,Kenji’s vote on our Seer Sakura feels suspicious—I think we should focus on him for today’s vote. Anyone disagree?
1,talk,32,2,6,Kenji’s vote stands out—but isn’t Servas staying too quiet? Wolves often hide there.  @Servas  can you share your thoughts?

1,talk,41,3,9,My vote’s going to Kenji. Voting our lone Seer is too bold to ignore. If you want the wolves out follow the logic.

1,talk,43,3,13,Deviating from the judgment of Kenji serves only to aid the culprits. Let us act with unity.

2,whisper,6,2,2, @Yumi  Agreed—bite Sakura next. Shizue  publicly push Mizuki-as-human and nudge suspicion toward Minato to try to bait the guard. I’ll stir votes tomorrow
2,whisper,7,2,1,Greetings dear friends. Like wise ants we must ponder Mizuki's silence. They wield knowledge with grace and understanding. @May Dear one. Mizuki. Have you encountered anything noteworthy in your recent endeavors? I'd love to hear all about your discoveries.
2,whisper,8,2,3,Let’s all vote Servas today—he’s easy to push. Tonight let’s definitely bite Sakura before she guides everyone against us.
2,whisper,9,3,2, @Yumi  Good plan — vote Servas now. We bite Sakura tonight. Shizue  push Mizuki-as-human and nudge suspicion toward Minato. Don’t claim roles; act shocked a
2,whisper,10,3,1,Oh my. Such a stir with dear Sakura or Minato as Seers. Might young Takumi or sweet Asuka hold the medium's or guard's role? @Yumi Oh dear. How about we claim to be humble villagers? Let's ward off suspicion with care. Soft action might just lead to success dear one.
2,whisper,11,3,3,Let’s all vote Servas today then bite Sakura tonight to break their info flow. If Sakura survives bite Minako next.

3,talk,2,0,3, @May  I’m worried about Mizuki—she keeps voting against Seer and gives no good reason. Isn’t that a wolf move?
3,talk,3,0,9, @Minato  you claimed seer—who did you divine each night and what were your results? Give details now or you look fake.
3,talk,4,0,13,The contract with the false seer is terminated. Yet  @Shizue  your dissonant testimony lingers.

3,talk,6,0,1,Dearest ones it seems Minato has taken on the important role of Seer. Shall we with gentle hearts ask for the insights he holds?
3,talk,7,0,8,I find Mizuki's votes on Seers odd. It's risky for us you know? Anyway she's evasive which could spell trouble pal. Thoughts?
3,talk,8,0,11,Do you think Sakura is truthful about being the Seer? Maybe she is. I think Kenji's lynching made things clearer for now.
3,talk,9,1,10,I will vote Asuka.

3,talk,13,1,13,Order must be restored.  @Shizue  your dissonant testimony yesterday is the clear source of this chaos.

3,talk,15,1,1,Sakura's attack might mean she was truly our Seer. Dear Minato might you divine young Mizuki? Her votes have stirred some doubts.

3,talk,17,1,11,If Sakura is attacked. Maybe we should trust her divination. Yumi. Do you think we should ask Shizue who to divine next to understand her?
3,talk,18,2,10,I will vote Asuka.

3,talk,20,2,3, @Takumi  Shizue keeps changing her story and questioning claims—that's suspicious behavior for a wolf  don't you think?
3,talk,21,2,9, @Minato  your Seer claim is suspicious. Name all your divinations and results now or I’ll vote you out.
3,talk,22,2,13,To pursue Minato is illogical. Judge Shizue who authored the lie that spawned this chaos.
3,talk,23,2,5,I’m the Medium. Kenji (Day1) = HUMAN. Servas (Day2) = HUMAN. Sakura was attacked last night.  @Asuka  please claim seer and give your divination result or plan now — if no seer claim I’ll nominate George tonight. Others state your vote or one-line read.
3,talk,24,2,1,Minato dear. Your divination details are vital right now. Please share them or we'll kindly rely on Sakura's insights instead.
3,talk,25,2,8,Shizue's explanations are confusing and even harmful. Sakura's insights matter more you know? Let's focus on clear defense anyway.
3,talk,26,2,11,I think Asuka's probing feels like she's trying to turn the focus away from her. Maybe I'll vote for Asuka tomorrow. What do you think?
3,talk,27,3,10,I will vote Asuka.

3,talk,29,3,3,I want to trust but Minato’s answers are always vague. We need safety—I’m voting Minato and hoping we’re right.

4,talk,4,0,11,Do you think we should figure out who benefits from all these claims? I feel Shizue's distrust is unfounded. We need clarity.
4,talk,5,0,8,Minako revealed Mizuki's human. Kenji's confirmed human too. So let's focus on Minato's incomplete claims now you know?
4,talk,6,0,9, @Minato  your Seer claim is empty unless you share every divination result. Why should we trust your silence now?
4,talk,7,1,1,With Minako confirming both Kenji and Mizuki as human our concern is elsewhere. Let's concentrate our vote on Minato today. Minato dear. Sharing you
4,talk,8,1,3, @Minato  if you truly have divination results you need to reveal them now—otherwise it looks wolf to stall.

4,talk,11,1,11,Do you think we need a divine choice? Maybe figuring out who's dangerous... Asuka's actions... They're questionable.  @Shizue  Strange! Accusations against me. I think... Focus... Who should the seer trust to divine next?
4,talk,12,1,8,Minato and Shizue clash. Let's vote or divine to find the truth now you know? Hey  @Shizue ! Who's your top suspect? Thoughts on Minato?

4,talk,14,2,1,Minato dear your claims seem rather vague. We are all quite eager to understand the details of your divination. Please do share.
4,talk,15,2,3, @Takumi  Minato hasn’t shared any divination again today. Shouldn’t we vote him out to protect the village?

4,talk,20,2,9,Minato unless you give every divination and result now I’m voting you out—this stalling only helps the wolves.
4,talk,21,3,1,Oh dear I'm a bit concerned! Minako claims to be the Medium yet hasn't divined Mizuki in a timely manner. It seems so misleading! @Takumi Takumi dear are you swayed by Minako's claims? Her actions seem quite werewolf-like. Let's share your thoughts lovingly.

4,talk,26,3,8, @Shizue  Minako's claim is shaky you know? Minato's next move matters. Do you trust him at all right now or not miss?
4,talk,27,3,9,With Sakura’s real results and Minato evading every question I’m voting Minato out—fake claims endanger the village.
