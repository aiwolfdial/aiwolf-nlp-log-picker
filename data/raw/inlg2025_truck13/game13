1,talk,2,0,4, @Shunichi  please provide your report. Our ability to make a sound judgment depends on it.
1,talk,3,0,1,I will vote Mizuki.
1,talk,4,0,7, @Asuka  your silence stands out. Are you just cautious or hiding something? Would you explain your position before voting?
1,talk,5,0,12,I am a seer. I divined Mizuki and Mizuki was a human.

1,talk,14,1,8,Now let me tell you. With two seer claims I advise the one true seer to maintain consistency in their results. Stay focused my friends!

1,talk,16,1,1,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,17,1,7,Misaki’s sudden voting changes are throwing me off. Is this confusion or a strategy to hide something?
1,talk,18,1,12,I will vote Mizuki.
1,talk,19,1,2,I think  @Misaki  your swift vote switches look suspicious. Can you explain your reasoning behind today's choices?
1,talk,20,1,13,Mr. Misaki. Ms. Shunichi. Your actions today seem quite unusual. Could we discuss your motivations calmly and openly? Rest assured.
1,talk,21,1,10,We can’t risk losing a real Seer now. Anyone pushing to exile them early is suspicious—look at who’s creating chaos.
1,talk,22,1,11,Shunichi's own vote is a huge contradiction. I-I think he is the most suspicious subject right now.

1,talk,32,2,2, @Shunichi  you voted Mizuki after calling her human Why? That’s suspicious Can you explain your reasoning?
1,talk,33,2,13,Given Mizuki and Shunichi's contradictions we shouldn't trust them. Let's think carefully about our votes. Remain composed.  @Asuka  Dear do you sense anything from all this talk about role claims? It's getting wild but how do you feel now?
1,talk,34,2,10,Why did  @Shunichi  vote Mizuki after claiming she’s Human? That contradiction stands out and feels like a wolf slip.
1,talk,35,2,11,From the hostile team's view... isn't Shunichi's contradiction too perfect? It feels like a d-decoy.

1,talk,42,3,1,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,43,3,7,Misaki’s erratic votes concern me most. She’s shifting without logic. I’ll vote Misaki today.
1,talk,44,3,12,I will vote Mizuki.
1,talk,45,3,2,Shunichi’s voting makes no sense with his own seer claim. He’s my vote today. I urge people to join for a firm decision.
1,talk,46,3,13,Ms. Rin's insistence on innocence cuts both ways. Remain composed. Are we truly observing truth or a classic werewolf tactic?
1,talk,47,3,10,Shunichi’s vote makes no sense if Mizuki is human. I’m voting Shunichi today—too suspicious to leave unchecked.
1,talk,48,3,11,Shunichi is a decoy. Removing the anomalous variable is a waste. I suspect Misakis chaotic voting more.

2,whisper,3,1,7,Let’s keep pushing for Toshio today. Don’t protect Yumi openly—she’s likely to get all the heat.
2,whisper,4,2,8,Now let me tell you. We must keep up the suspicion on Mr. Toshio and Ms. Asuka. You see constant pressure may reveal their hand. @Shion You see. Keep our roles secret my friend. Ensure Toshio is under scrutiny. Silence you know. It can work in our favor.
2,whisper,5,2,7,Let’s focus all votes on Toshio today so we blend in. If Yumi stays the target just let her go.
2,whisper,6,3,8,Now let me tell you. A push for a vote on Mrs. Minako or Mrs. Mizuki should shift our game. Identifying them as threats could serve us. @Shion Now let me tell you. It might be wise to consider focusing on Minako and Mizuki. Observe their actions closely my friend.

4,talk,22,2,13,The strategy is clear. Voting for George aligns with insightful visions. Group consensus matters. Rest assured.  @Shion  With my seer role confirmed please analyze George's actions closely. Can you share any evidence supporting or refuting him?
