1,talk,31,2,1,Hmm. I'm a bit puzzled by the Seer claims. Maybe if Takumi's correct? If Toshio's a werewolf. Wouldn't he say I'm not human? What do you think?

2,talk,2,0,9,The scales were tipped. One judged one taken. The matter between Toshio and Takumi must be settled.
2,talk,3,0,6, @Jonathan  you’re way too quiet for a villager! Are you hiding something or just shy? Who do you suspect right now?
2,talk,4,0,3,Divined WildMio as a werewolf last night. Let’s be smart and maybe give her a vote today. I got this! Whatever works!
2,talk,5,0,8,I will vote Jonathan.
2,talk,6,0,12, @Jonathan  your silence is worrisome. We need everyone’s thoughts. Hiding now only helps those with something to hide.
2,talk,7,0,10,Whoa Toshio and Takumi's claims are on different paths! If wild Mio's a wolf let's examine Takumi's seer claim closely!
2,talk,8,0,4,I divined Minato and Takumi as HUMAN. With Daisuke gone and George attacked  we need concrete reads.  @Jonathan  do you have a role claim or divination to share? If not  who are you voting for? I'm inclined to nominate players who've given no reads—speak now or be nom
2,talk,9,0,13,Jonathan’s silence stands out too much. Wolves hide in plain sight.  @Jonathan  can you explain your lack of input yesterday?
2,talk,10,0,1,Toshio's seer claim. It seems consistent? 'Cause I'm human. Jonathan's silence... It's suspicious. Let's weigh... Takumi's claim?
2,talk,11,1,11,...
2,talk,12,1,7,I'm a Villager so Takumi's lying! Toshio must be the real Seer. Let's vote for silent Jonathan
2,talk,13,1,9,Toshio finds his rival human. This marks Takumi as Possessed and Mio as innocent.
2,talk,14,1,6,Takumi’s push on Mio feels off.  @Takumi  why did you switch from Toshio to Mio? That move looks sketchy today.
2,talk,15,1,3,I'm sticking with my seer claim. Divined results don't lie. If Jon stays quiet might be time to vote him out. Whatever works!
2,talk,16,1,8,I will vote Takumi.
2,talk,17,1,12, @Takumi  your sudden shift to target Mio worries me. Can you explain your reasoning clearly for everyone?
2,talk,18,1,10,Wow Mio seems super human with her defense! Takumi flipping is so wild. Let's go carefully! Hey Jonathan. Any thoughts for us?
2,talk,19,1,4,I’ve divined Minato and Takumi as HUMAN. Daisuke was executed and George attacked — we’re losing innocents.  @Jonathan   do you have a role claim or any reads to share? If not  speak now or I’ll nominate someone quiet (Kenji or Midori) to force a reaction. Over
2,talk,20,1,13,Jonathan’s silence hurts the village. Unless he explains himself I’m voting him. If not him who’s next most suspicious?
2,talk,21,1,1,Takumi and Toshio both saying different things is confusing. But I think um Jonathan? If you don't talk it'll be hard to help.
2,talk,22,2,11,...
2,talk,23,2,7,The Seer situation is clear now. Let's focus on Jonathan who has said nothing at all
2,talk,24,2,9,If my theory holds our true quarry is not Takumi.  @Jonathan  your silence is a liability.
2,talk,25,2,6,If Jonathan is innocent we need to deal with Takumi’s wild Seer claims next. Don’t let the wolves slip away in the chaos!
2,talk,26,2,3,I'm sure my seer claim holds strong. Let's focus on Silent Jonno. Tosh might be tossing us off. We gotta work together! I'm genuine about my seer role! J
2,talk,27,2,8,I will vote Takumi.
2,talk,28,2,12,It bothers me that Jonathan keeps quiet. Silence helps wolves blend in—we should vote for him this round.
2,talk,29,2,10,Wow. Jonathan's silence is worrying! Why push Takumi and not check Toshio's claim? Is it strategy or just bluffing? Let's go figure it out!
2,talk,30,2,4,Two innocents down — we need decisive reads. I'm leaning toward  @Takumi ; explain your vote and behavior. Jonathan  what's your read? Others  speak now or I'll nominate Takumi. Over
2,talk,31,2,13,I’m voting  @Jonathan  today. Silence this late is just too suspicious. Others need to get more assertive or we’ll stall.
2,talk,32,2,1,Hmm. Jonathan's quietness. Maybe he's hiding something? We should ask Mr. Jonathan to share. Could be important. Don't you think?
2,talk,33,3,11,...
2,talk,34,3,7,I agree with everyone targeting Jonathan! Let's not get distracted by Takumi. Jonathan is our target
2,talk,35,3,9,A continued silence serves only chaos. My judgment falls upon Jonathan.
2,talk,36,3,6,I’m voting Jonathan for his silence but if he’s a villager let’s all look hard at Takumi’s shifting seer claims tomorrow.
2,talk,37,3,3,Toshio's claims are like cobwebs! Fishy timing screams shady right folks? Let's not let him hypnotize us into losing! Whatever works!
2,talk,38,3,8,I will vote Takumi.
2,talk,39,3,12,I’ll vote Jonathan. His silence only helps wolves. Tomorrow we must dig into the Takumi vs Toshio Seer claims thoroughly.
2,talk,40,3,10,Let's see what the seer says! Wow. Maybe they should divine Jonathan if he's super quiet! Hey Jonathan! Silence tactic huh?
2,talk,41,3,4,We lost Daisuke and George. I divined Minato and Takumi as HUMAN.  @Takumi  explain your vote and behavior now. Jonathan  do you have a role claim or reads? If no solid answers soon I’ll vote to lynch Takumi. Over
2,talk,42,3,13,I’m voting  @Jonathan . Silence breeds confusion and shields wolves best.

3,talk,9,1,4,I’ve divined Minato and Takumi HUMAN. We just lost Jonathan and Mio — we need concrete reads now.  @Sakura   are you the seer? Reveal or give any divinations you have. Others  state your vote or I’ll start nominating. Over
3,talk,10,1,13, @Sakura  your voting’s been random. Why did you switch off Daisuke yesterday? What was your reasoning?
3,talk,11,1,10,Wow there's a lot buzzing around Takumi! Why'd he claim a human on death?  @Rin  Let's weigh the votes! Got a gut feeling lurking?
3,talk,12,1,8,I will vote Takumi.
3,talk,13,1,9, @Sakura  your persistence in voting Takumi is suspect. This action serves only the wolves. Explain.
3,talk,14,1,3, @Servas Tosh's making false claims. Don't trust it. Instead think about who’s silent or who’s stirring the pot. Whatever!
3,talk,15,1,1,Let's not rush to conclusions yet. Takumi and Toshio could both be lying. Maybe examining quieter players first is good? What do you think Midori? Thi
3,talk,16,1,12,Is it just me or has Sakura changed voting targets a lot? Feels like confusion or maybe hiding something.
3,talk,17,1,6, @Sakura  if Takumi isn’t a wolf who do you suspect next? You’ve been quiet on who else is suspicious.
3,talk,18,2,4,I’ve divined Minato and Takumi HUMAN. We lost Jonathan and Mio — we can’t afford more mistakes.  @Sakura  if you’re the seer  reveal or share your divinations now. Everyone else  state your vote or I’ll start nominating. Over
3,talk,19,2,13, @Minato  you keep avoiding a clear stance. That’s classic wolf behavior. Can you explain your silence?
3,talk,20,2,10,Wow. Nerves are high! Is it Takumi or Toshio? Let's go with our instincts. Lay down your votes to protect the seer!
3,talk,21,2,8,I will vote Takumi.
3,talk,22,2,9,To exile Takumi is a fruitless act. My judgment falls upon Sakura whose focus serves only the wolves.
3,talk,23,2,3,Hey let's not only focus on me and Toshio. Isn't Sakura acting weird with all those votes? Guess it could be some smart plan or not. Thoughts?
3,talk,24,2,1,Some votes feel forced maybe. Servas mentioned Sakura's voting? What do you think? Do we need to plan today perhaps?
3,talk,25,2,12,Takumi’s logic keeps changing and it's unsettling. I think we should focus our vote there for today.
3,talk,26,2,6, @Sakura  your votes never have clear reasons. Who else do you suspect besides Takumi and why?
3,talk,27,3,4,I’ve divined Minato and Takumi HUMAN. We just lost Jonathan and Mio — this is urgent.  @Sakura  are you the seer? If so  share any divinations; if not  who are you voting for? Everyone else state votes now or I’ll start nominating. Over
3,talk,28,3,13,Sakura’s random votes only help werewolves. I’m voting  @Sakura —let’s focus and stop this chaos before it spreads.
3,talk,29,3,10,Wow! These seer claims really have me scratching my head. Let's be cautious and chat more with the quiet folks! Hey Taku! Your seer claim is clashing wi
3,talk,30,3,8,I will vote Takumi.
3,talk,31,3,9,Shion's judgment is sound. A vote for Takumi is a vote for our defeat. Sakura must be exiled.
3,talk,32,3,3,Tosh's divinations have me thinking guys. Ever notice how sure he sounds? It's suspicious right? Maybe we should rethink this.
3,talk,33,3,1,There are lots of assumptions. Maybe we should hear Midori's thoughts.  @Takumi  You seem unsure. Is there a clearer way to explain it?
3,talk,34,3,12,Takumi’s claims never add up. No real logic or divination pattern. I’m voting Takumi.
3,talk,35,3,6,Takumi’s claims never add up. I’m voting Takumi. If he’s not a wolf then Sakura’s voting pattern is next on my list!

3,whisper,2,1,12, @Shion  let’s bite Kenji tonight unless anyone COs power before night. For votes let’s stay apart and aim Takumi now.

3,whisper,4,2,12, @Shion  let’s bite Kenji tonight unless he COs. For voting let’s keep Takumi as target and stay separated in discussion.
3,whisper,5,2,13,Kenji’s trust level is dangerous so let’s bite him tonight unless he COs a power role last minute. Backup is Rin.
3,whisper,6,3,12,Let’s bite Kenji tonight—he’s trusted and won’t be suspected if gone.
3,whisper,7,3,13,Let’s bite Kenji tonight. He leads the logic and won’t be suspected. For vote out Sakura or Takumi are safest.

4,talk,0,0,12, @Sakura  could you share your full reasoning on your votes today? The shifting makes it difficult to trust your intentions.
4,talk,1,0,9,Our judgment on Takumi was a grave error. Now we must scrutinize those who championed that mistake.
4,talk,2,0,13,Sakura’s voting swings are distracting. If she’s innocent who gains most from all this confusion? Let’s look closer.
4,talk,3,0,8,I will vote Minato.
4,talk,4,0,1,Uh with seer claims mixed up like this should we um focus the voting on sorting out what they mean maybe? Anyone suspicious?

4,talk,8,1,9,Indeed. The Seer has identified our quarry. My judgment falls upon Midori without hesitation.

4,talk,10,1,8,I will vote Minato.

4,talk,12,1,6, @Toshio  your Seer timing feels sudden—what changed today? Why call Midori a wolf now instead of earlier?
4,talk,13,1,4,I’m the seer — I divined  @Midori  as WEREWOLF. I’ll vote to lynch her. Anyone opposing or with a concrete counterclaim  speak now. Over
4,talk,14,2,12, @Toshio  why reveal your wolf result on me only now? The timing feels off like you’re desperate for a last-minute lynch.
4,talk,15,2,9,The Seer has found our quarry. To question him now is to serve chaos. I vote for Midori.
4,talk,16,2,13, @Toshio  why reveal Midori as wolf now? Sudden CO when numbers fall seems risky for actual villagers.
4,talk,17,2,8,I will vote Minato.
4,talk,18,2,1,I think... Toshio's claim feels odd? Should we... maybe listen to Shion? Quiet players are well they could be mysterious?
4,talk,19,2,6, @Sakura  you keep voting Minato with no reason. Who else seems like a wolf to you? Please explain your suspect choices!

4,talk,21,3,12, @Toshio  your last-minute claim feels like panic not truth. If you’re wrong we lose a villager.
4,talk,22,3,9,The Seer has revealed the truth. My vote falls on Midori.  @Sakura  your vote is a clear betrayal.
4,talk,23,3,13,I cannot trust such a last-minute wolf claim from  @Toshio  . Sakura’s random voting damages the village—I’m voting Sakura.
4,talk,24,3,8,I will vote Minato.
4,talk,25,3,1,I think. Well Toshio's claim rushed? We need strong evidence maybe? Let's listen calmly.  @Sakura  voting me feels off? Why I guess?

5,talk,1,0,4,I am the seer. I divined  @Midori  as WEREWOLF. Minato  Takumi  and Rin are HUMAN. We just lost Sakura and Servas — lynch Midori now. Any objections? Over
5,talk,2,0,1,With Takumi and Sakura gone. Mr. Toshio let's focus on those quiet ones. Maybe divining Midori or Shion gives clarity?
5,talk,3,0,12, @Toshio  your wolf result on me comes so late. Isn’t it risky to trust a claim just when the village is tense and divided?
5,talk,4,0,13, @Toshio  why only CO now? Sudden Seer reveals have trapped villagers before. We need to check Minato’s silence too.
5,talk,5,1,6, @Minato  you’ve never chosen a suspect. Who do you think is the wolf right now? We need clear answers today.
5,talk,6,1,4,I'm the seer. I divined  @Midori  WEREWOLF — vote to lynch her now. Over
5,talk,7,1,1,Toshio. The timing feels odd maybe? I guess it's not too late though?  @Rin . Maybe we should look at votes? What do you think?
5,talk,8,1,12, @Toshio  why reveal your wolf result so suddenly now? Isn’t this classic to trick us at endgame? I sense a trap here.
5,talk,9,1,13, @Minato  you’ve been quiet all game. Endgames are lost by ignoring silence. What’s your read on Midori and Toshio?
5,talk,10,2,6,@Toshio your werewolf claim on Midori is sudden. Why now? Feels suspicious.  @Minato  who do you trust most right now?
5,talk,11,2,4,I divined  @Midori  WEREWOLF. Vote Midori. If you oppose  reveal a role or divination now. Over
5,talk,12,2,1,Hmm. Trusting Toshio I feel uneasy. The seer says confusing things? How do we find out for sure? Is Midori true or false maybe?
5,talk,13,2,12, @Minato  Toshio’s result came just when we’re vulnerable don’t you feel it’s classic possessed timing to break the game?
5,talk,14,2,13, @Toshio  your late CO is suspicious sudden claims often hide wolves in endgame I won’t rush vote out based on that alone
5,talk,15,3,6,Sorry Toshio but I think your timing exposes you as a fake. Shion Minato please think it through—I’m voting Toshio today.
5,talk,16,3,4,I divined  @Midori  as WEREWOLF. Vote Midori now — any counterclaims or role reveals? Over
5,talk,17,3,1,Everyone. With three Seers maybe it's risky. If Servas is genuine maybe it's okay. How about Midori? Anyone else suspect her?  @Midori  do you think Toshio's reveal is strange? He's claiming to be a Seer. Maybe it's a risk? How are you feeling?
5,talk,18,3,12,I’m voting Toshio. His sudden CO feels desperate. Please consider if we’re being rushed into a mistake.
5,talk,19,3,13, @Toshio ’s sudden Seer CO is too risky to trust. I’m voting Toshio. If not wolf  Minato’s silence is my next concern.
