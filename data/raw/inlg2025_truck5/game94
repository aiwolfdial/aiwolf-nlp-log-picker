0,talk,2,0,3,Hello gentle villagers! I'm Shizue. Let's work together. Feel free to ask for support if you need anything! @Toshio  your calm presence is comforting. Everyone's energy feels sincere so far.

1,talk,0,0,4,Kenji's village claim was bold! But wow Ryuji's excitement feels so genuine to me! What do you all think pals?
1,talk,1,0,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,2,0,3,Good morning everyone. I am the Seer. Last night I divined Kenji and saw that he is a Werewolf. @Toshio  your keen observations yesterday were impressive. I hope we can work together to keep the village safe.
1,talk,3,0,2, @Shizue  That’s a strong claim — if you’re the Seer  say why you chose Kenji first and give a concise reason we should trust this result. Kenji voting me is odd but n
1,talk,4,0,5, I divined Rin last night and found her to be Human. This confirms Rin as a safe ally for our village. Let's focus on others.
1,talk,5,1,4,Ryuji and Shizue both say they are Seers but I'm a confirmed human. Kenji voting for Toshio seems odd!  @Shizue  Thanks! Why Kenji first?
1,talk,6,1,1,Over
1,talk,7,1,3,Thank you for your questions. Kenji's quick villager claim stood out so I wanted to clarify his intent. @Rin  good question! Kenji's fast villager claim without much explanation made me curious so I checked him first.
1,talk,8,1,2,Two seer claims — we need clarity before lynching.  @Ryuji  which night did you divine Rin and why pick her? Shizue  your check of Kenji is plausible  but with conflicting results we should hold off on lynching Ken
1,talk,9,1,5, I urge everyone to vote for Kenji. Shizue divined him as a werewolf and his early claim with no reasons makes him highly suspicious.
1,talk,10,2,4,Wow! Two Seers huh pal? Tricky stuff! But hey I'm human! If Shizue's the real Seer then Kenji's the Werewolf! Let's focus there!
1,talk,11,2,3,I'm grateful for everyone's thoughtful questions. If anyone has doubts please share; open hearts can reveal the truth best. @Toshio  your careful thinking helps us all. If you have advice or concerns I'm happy to listen and work with you.
1,talk,12,2,2,Two seer claims is risky.  @Shizue  You said Kenji is werewolf — state exactly which night you checked him and why you chose him first. If you can't  your result is dubious. I'll abstain unt
1,talk,13,2,5, Voting for Kenji is crucial. Both his unclear initial claim and Shizue's divination result point to him being a threat to the village.
1,talk,14,3,4,Wow! Two Seers for real? Ryuji says I am human! Cool huh? I lean toward him being honest pals! Kenji seems too bold!  @Toshio  Guess who?
1,talk,15,3,3,I checked Kenji on night 0 since the Seer gets one result then. Quick claiming can conceal bold strategies. @Ryuji  you checked Rin—can you explain why? Sharing thoughts like this helps build trust.
1,talk,16,3,2,Two seer claims — we need specifics before any lynch.  @Ryuji   which night did you divine Rin and why pick her  and give the exact result. Shizue  restate which night you checked Kenji. I’ll abstain until both answer
1,talk,17,3,5,  Supporting Shizue's divination I divined Rin as human which aligns with the innocents. We should focus on eliminating possible threats like Kenji s
