0,talk,1,0,5,Hello. I'm Shion. Thrilled to partake in this game with you all. Let's aim for a strategic victory together! Over.
0,talk,2,0,1,Good morning  friends. Thank you  Servas and Shion. I felt a little uneasy about  @Benjamin  earlier — could you share what you're thinking and why you acted that way? Everyone else  any small impressions you noticed? Let's speak kindly. Over

1,talk,0,0,2, @Shizue  accusing based on tone alone isn’t logical. Who else stands out as suspicious to you today?
1,talk,1,0,1,I was uneasy before  but I don't have solid evidence now.  @Jonathan  you said you were a villager early — what made you announce so quickly? Everyone else  please share any little oddities you've noticed. Over
1,talk,2,0,3,My friends each dawn brings new light. Pause observe kindly: share not just what you see but why you feel so. @Jonathan  I have often found that swift declarations can conceal or reveal much. Was there reason for your early claim?
1,talk,3,0,4,I will vote Shizue.
1,talk,4,0,5,I divined Servas as a Werewolf. Let's analyze this carefully. Emotional reactions only cloud judgment. Any thoughts on this everyone?
1,talk,5,1,2, @Servas  do you admit Shion’s Seer claim or will you CO yourself? Your silence after being shown black is troubling.
1,talk,6,1,1,My dears  I must be honest now — I'm the seer. Last night I divined Benjamin and he was HUMAN. I'm sorry I was hasty accusing him earlier.  @Shion   you said Servas is werewolf — when did you divine and why do you trust that result? Please  friends  reconsider and share what you saw. Over
1,talk,7,1,3,Accusations spread fast friends! I'm just a villager wrongly accused. @Shion  why did you divine me? Can we trust two seers showing up at once?
1,talk,8,1,4,Over
1,talk,9,1,5,Our goal might be to align our divination with the claims of being a Seer. What do you deduce from this notion?
1,talk,10,2,2,With two Seers exposed someone is lying. I lean toward voting Servas if Shion’s claim isn’t challenged. Thoughts?
1,talk,11,2,1,My dears — as I said  I'm the seer and I divined Benjamin as HUMAN last night. If  @Shion  truly saw Servas as WOLF  then either there are two seers or someone is lying. @Shion  when did you divine Servas and what made you confident in that resul
1,talk,12,2,3,Wisdom grows with patience. Both Shizue and Shion claim Seer—a puzzle. Let us weigh gently. @Benjamin  when two clashed before haste led to regret. Why do you trust Shion over Shizue so quickly?
1,talk,13,2,5,Shizue's claim clashes with me. Servas is a Werewolf. We should vote him out!  @Servas  Cornered here? Any revelations perhaps?
1,talk,14,3,2,Shizue cleared me as human so I’ll vote Servas. If anyone objects or has new evidence speak up before voting.
1,talk,15,3,1,My dears  I already said I divined Benjamin as HUMAN — so either Shion's seer claim is false or something strange is afoot.  @Jonathan  you voted me so quickly — may I ask why? That hurried vote feels suspicious. I’m leaning to vote Jonathan unless someone gives a clear reason not to. Ple
1,talk,16,3,3,My heart remains steady despite being under suspicion. If we slow down and listen truths often emerge quietly among us. @Shion  your gaze fell on me so soon. Was it intuition or a reason from my words or ways? Reflection can reveal much.
1,talk,17,3,5,Servas's serene act seems typical werewolf misdirection. Maximus if we don't vote for him now the regret might haunt us.

2,talk,0,0,5,Jonathan. I divined you as a Werewolf. Let's channel our votes wisely today to mitigate this hairy predicament.
2,talk,1,0,4,I will vote Shizue.
2,talk,2,0,1,Oh my — Benjamin was attacked and Servas was lynched. I divined Benjamin HUMAN  so Shion’s claim looks suspicious.  @Jonathan  please tell us your role and why you voted me earlier; if you won’t  I’ll have to vote for you. Please decide quickly. Over
2,talk,3,1,5,I propose we direct our divination efforts towards either Jonathan or Shizue tonight. Clarity is needed on their doubts and claims.

2,talk,5,1,1,My dears  Servas was lynched and Benjamin attacked. I divined Benjamin HUMAN earlier  so  @Shion  your seer claim worries me — when did you divine Servas and why so sure? Jonathan  please tell us your role and why you voted for me; otherwise I must consi
2,talk,6,2,5,Jonathan. With Benjamin out and Servas gone. I'm curious why the swift vote against Shizue. Clarity aids our decisions.
2,talk,7,2,1,My dears — I divined Benjamin as HUMAN last night  so I'm troubled by Shion’s claim.  @Shion  please tell us exactly when you divined Servas and what you saw  and why you trust that result. Jonathan  could you explain why you voted for me? Everyone
2,talk,8,3,5,Jonathan. Your voting speed and slippery answers suit a lycanthrope's shrewdness all too well. One mistrust and all collapses.
