1,talk,0,0,1,Let the one who can pierce the veil of night present their report. Order demands it.
1,talk,1,0,2,I’d like the Seer to CO now—we need solid info to guide today’s discussion and avoid just guessing.
1,talk,2,0,4,...
1,talk,3,0,3,If the Seer has useful insights now would be a good time to share them with us.
1,talk,4,0,5,I am the Seer. As far as I can ascertain my divination results show Ryuji as Human. Let's direct our focus elsewhere.
1,talk,5,1,1,A single Seer has declared. Without a counter his words carry the weight of truth.
1,talk,6,1,2, @Shion  you’ve barely spoken. Can you say what you think about Benjamin’s Seer CO and his result today?
1,talk,7,1,4,...
1,talk,8,1,3,Shion your thoughts would be valuable here. Do you trust Benjamin's claim as Seer?
1,talk,9,1,5,I find Shion's silence quite intriguing. If my calculations are correct it could be a tactic to avoid unwanted attention. Suspicious?
1,talk,10,2,1,With Ryuji cleared our judgment must fall upon the unconfirmed agents Minako and Shion.
1,talk,11,2,2, @Shion  you’ve been really quiet. Who do you suspect most right now Minako or George? Please share your view.
1,talk,12,2,4,...
1,talk,13,2,3,Shion we need your input. Your silence is concerning. Please share your thoughts on this.
1,talk,14,2,5,Minako and George. We must concentrate our energies. With Ryuji confirmed human Shion's silence is troubling.  @Minako  How do you view Shion's lack of response? Could it be a strategic silence?
1,talk,15,3,1,Let us consider the perspective of chaos. Whose silence aids their cause the most?
1,talk,16,3,2,Shion’s silence after so many prompts is too suspicious to ignore. I’m voting Shion.
1,talk,17,3,4,...
1,talk,18,3,3,Shion's silence does seem strategic. We need to hear from Shion to make an informed decision.
1,talk,19,3,5,Concealed thoughts carry a certain peril do they not? Shion has shared no wisdom with us. As far as I can ascertain my vote is clear.

2,talk,0,0,3,We've lost Benjamin. We need to assess our situation carefully and act decisively today.
2,talk,1,0,2, @Minako  who do you suspect as the werewolf now and what makes you think so? We need concrete reasons today.
2,talk,2,0,1, @Ryuji  The Seer was attacked. His last will cleared you. Therefore my judgment must fall on Minako.
2,talk,3,1,3,George your quick suspicion of me feels hasty. We should consider all possibilities.
2,talk,4,1,2, @George  you seem sure Minako is the wolf. Why? Can you explain your reasoning beyond just the Seer result?
2,talk,5,1,1, @Ryuji  The Seer was attacked thus he was true. His contract cleared you. Mine binds me to order. Vote Minako.
2,talk,6,2,3,Ryuji consider George's insistence. It could be a diversion. Let's think carefully.
2,talk,7,2,2, @George  relying just on math is risky. What did Minako say or do that felt like a wolf trying to blend in?
2,talk,8,2,1, @Ryuji  The facts are the bedrock of our judgment. Your humanity is proven. Minako is the only variable.
2,talk,9,3,3,Ryuji let's not rush. George's logic seems too focused. It's crucial to stay open-minded.
2,talk,10,3,2,My vote goes to  @George . A true villager would try to read people not just push a formula.
2,talk,11,3,1, @Ryuji  Do not mistake logic for a mere formula. It is our only truth. Minako is the enemy.
