1,talk,0,0,3, @Kenji  can you share your divination result please? It’s important we have all the info before making decisions.
1,talk,1,0,5, Let's wait for Kenji's divination results that could guide our decisions and clear some suspicions.
1,talk,2,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Rin and Rin was a human.
1,talk,3,0,4,Consider this. Kenji's claim holds weight as Rin is proven human. Let us now examine Mizuki and Yumi for any incongruities.
1,talk,4,0,1,Thank you Kenji! Asuka do you have any concerns about Mizuki or Yumi?
1,talk,5,1,3, @Asuka  you moved quickly to suspect Mizuki and me. Can you explain your logic a bit more so we’re clear on your view?
1,talk,6,1,5,Let's vote for Rin despite the divination result. Rin's eagerness for Kenji's divination could be a tactic to gain trust.
1,talk,7,1,2,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,8,1,4,Mr. Kenji. I find your vote curious. Perhaps divination guided you? Ms. Yumi. I noted inconsistencies within our limited group.
1,talk,9,1,1,Mizuki I'm curious why you'd vote for me after Kenji's divination confirmed I'm human.
1,talk,10,2,3, @Mizuki  why do you want to vote Rin after Kenji’s result showed she’s human? That doesn’t make sense to me.
1,talk,11,2,5,Rin's behavior could be a strategy by the possessed to redirect suspicions and protect the werewolf.
1,talk,12,2,2,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,13,2,4,Ms. Mizuki. Consider this. Voting for Rin is counterproductive if Rin is indeed human. We should focus on behaviors that contradict the evidence pre
1,talk,14,2,1,Mizuki let's focus on evidence. Why risk voting me when Kenji confirmed I'm human?
1,talk,15,3,3, @Mizuki  your logic confuses me. Voting for a confirmed human isn’t helpful. I’m voting Mizuki to protect the village.
1,talk,16,3,5,I understand the concerns but let's not ignore possible manipulation tactics. Vote Rin and observe reactions; it might reveal more.
1,talk,17,3,2,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,18,3,4,Ms. Mizuki. Consider this. Voting for a cleared villager like Rin may raise suspicion. Let's find contradictions. It is crucial!
1,talk,19,3,1,Yumi thanks for trusting the divination. Mizuki let's focus on finding real contradictions.
