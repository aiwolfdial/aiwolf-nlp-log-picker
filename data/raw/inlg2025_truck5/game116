0,talk,0,0,2,Hello everyone I'm Victoria! Excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have some fun and good luck guessing!
0,talk,1,0,4,Good morning   @Victoria  — nice to meet you. Could everyone say if you have any role claims or early suspicions? I think we should avoid rushing a lynch today. Over
0,talk,2,0,3,Hi everyone! I'm Mio and I'm just a regular old Villager here. Let's all do our best together and keep things positive! @George Hey George good point on not rushing! For me I don't have any special role claims—just a clumsy Villager here haha.
0,talk,3,0,5,Hello everyone! I'm Sakura! So nice to meet you all! Wow! Let's dive into this adventure together and have a blast!
0,talk,4,0,1,Hello. I am May. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,2,Over
0,talk,6,1,4, @May  you claim seer — could you tell us your first divination result and when you checked them? I prefer we avoid rushing a lynch until we have concrete info.

0,talk,10,2,4, @May  you claimed seer — please tell us who you divined  when you checked them  and the result. If you need time  say so. I’d rather avoid a reckless lynch today. O
0,talk,11,3,4, @May  please tell us who you checked and the result  or explain if you need more time. I prefer we don't lynch without clear info. Over

1,talk,0,0,3,Good morning everyone! May could you share your divination result now? It'll help us start right! @May  could you tell us your first divination result? We need all the info we can get!
1,talk,1,0,2,I divined George last night and he is Human. We should focus our suspicions elsewhere.
1,talk,2,0,4,Thanks for that  Victoria.  @May  please reveal who you divined  the result  and when — we need to resolve these divination claims before voting. Over
1,talk,3,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Sakura and Sakura was a human.
1,talk,4,0,5,Wow! I'm so glad May saw I'm human! But who can we trust now Giggles? We need more chats and claims before we vote huh? Ooh!
1,talk,5,1,3,Now that both Victoria and May claimed Seer one must be fake right? Let's hear everyone's thoughts before we jump ahead! @Sakura  your energy is always fun! How do you feel about two Seers right off the bat? Feels fishy doesn't it?
1,talk,6,1,2, I assure you all that I am the real Seer here. May's claim is suspicious and we should question it further.
1,talk,7,1,4,Both May and Victoria claim seer  so one of them is likely lying.  @Victoria  please say which night you divined me and if you checked anyone else. May  please state when you checked Sakura. I don't want us to lynch today until this
1,talk,8,1,1,I will vote George.
1,talk,9,1,5,Wow! May's vote for George? Looks hasty! No rush Smarty. We need to chat with those Seers.  @Mio  Two Seers? Ooh! Let's dig in!
1,talk,10,2,3,May's quick vote on George feels off—let's not rush. We should hear from everyone before making a decision! @May  you voted for George really quick! Can you share your reason? Let's talk before judging anyone.
1,talk,11,2,2, As the true Seer I checked George Night 1 and confirmed he is Human. May's behavior and premature vote suggest deceit.
1,talk,12,2,4,Two seer claims is risky.  @May  please tell us exactly which night you divined Sakura and when you announced it. Victoria says she checked me on Night 1 — can you confirm when you poste
1,talk,13,2,1,Over
1,talk,14,2,5,Wow! May and Victoria both saying they’re Seers is a bit risky Giggles! Maybe we chat first before voting! Sharing ideas is smart!
1,talk,15,3,3,It’s pretty suspicious that May voted so early for George! Let’s get thoughts from everyone before we decide—no need to rush! @Sakura  your excitement always lifts the mood! Who seems most trustworthy to you now that both May and Victoria claimed Seer?
1,talk,16,3,2, My divination is reliable; May’s claim and premature vote raise doubts. Misleading votes are a typical move by Werewolves and the Possessed.
1,talk,17,3,4,Both May and Victoria claim seer.  @May  please state exactly which night you divined Sakura and when you announced it. Victoria  please also say when you checked me. I prefer we skip lynch tod
1,talk,18,3,5,Wow! Victoria's like a classic werewolf. Ooh! She's playing follow-the-leader with George's humanity. Let's not be fooled. Haha! Let's dig deeper @Victoria Wow! So quick to trust Mister George huh Giggles? Why no self-divination or finding deeper clues to back you up buddy?

2,talk,0,0,5,Wow! So Victoria divined buddy George as human! Let's shake up our detective hats pals and find that sneaky werewolf! Ooh!
2,talk,1,0,4,Morning. With Victoria attacked and May executed  Victoria was likely the real seer and May fake. We need to find the wolves.  @Sakura  did you check anyone or have a strong read? Mio  what do you think we should do next? I don't want a blind lynch. Over
2,talk,2,0,3,With Victoria gone I lean to trusting her read that George is human. Sakura any hunches or things bugging you today? @George Thanks for asking George! I think discussing everyone's votes and thoughts today is key especially since Victoria's gone!
2,talk,3,1,5,Victoria's read was super helpful! George is safe. Mio's thoughts are key!  @Mio  Buddy now that Victoria gave the thumbs up what's your plan?
2,talk,4,1,4,Morning. Victoria being attacked makes her look real and May fake.  @Sakura  please tell us if you checked anyone and your result. Mio  what's your read? I don't want a blind lynch. Over
2,talk,5,1,3,Victoria's read helps so I'd say Sakura or me is the target. Sakura your vibes seem cheery but I want to dig deeper! @Sakura  you keep the energy up! Got any suspicions today or a reason to clear someone new?
2,talk,6,2,5,Wow! Victoria's insights still echo and guide us huh? Ooh! Okay folks. Let's huddle up and let the seer check Mio next! Sound fun?
2,talk,7,2,4,Morning. Victoria attacked = likely real seer  May likely fake.  @Sakura  did you check anyone last night and what was the result? Mio  who do you suspect now? I don't want a blind lynch. Over
2,talk,8,2,3,Victoria's trust in George helps us! Between Sakura and me who has more to hide? Let's chat this out! @George Hey George you want to avoid blind lynches. Who are you most curious about today? Let's reason it out!
2,talk,9,3,5,Let's check Mio tonight with Victoria's plan! Wow! That'll help us find a villager or a wolf. Fun right? Mister George agree?
2,talk,10,3,4,Morning. Victoria being attacked makes her look like the real seer and May likely fake.  @Sakura  did you check anyone last night? Please tell us your result. I don't want a blind lynch — Mio  who do you suspect? Over
2,talk,11,3,3,Alright Sakura keeps dodging and skipping night results—getting suspicious! Let's be alert and share info openly! @Sakura  you keep talking about checking me but where's yesterday's result? Did you divine or are you hiding?
