0,talk,0,0,5,Let's focus on gathering information and observing behaviors carefully today.
0,talk,1,0,4,Hey team. Shunichi here. Eager to dive into this game with you all. Let's keep it mellow and win as a unit. Over.
0,talk,2,0,1,I'll stay quiet and watch for slips.  @Asuka  — since you want to observe  who caught your eye first and why? Over

0,talk,5,1,5,It's early but Shunichi's enthusiasm stands out. Let's see how the day unfolds.

0,talk,7,1,1,Takumi's silence worries me—quiet players often hide something.  @Takumi  any early read or are you just observing? If no answer  I'll watch you closely. Over
0,talk,8,1,2,I am Minako. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. .
0,talk,9,1,3,Over
0,talk,10,2,5,Victoria I agree that silence can be telling. Let's keep an eye on Takumi.
0,talk,11,2,1, @Asuka  you were quick to pin Takumi — what exactly made you suspect him? Say it plainly so we can judge. Over
0,talk,12,2,2,This initial maneuvering is noted. True intentions will surface in due time.
0,talk,13,3,5,Victoria it was more about noting the silence. No strong suspicion yet just cautious.
0,talk,14,3,1,Let's not lynch someone for being quiet alone.  @Asuka  are you pushing to nominate Takumi now  or just advising we watch? I prefer waiting to gather more. Over
0,talk,15,3,2,Speculation is a currency of low value. Let us wait for hard assets.

1,talk,0,0,5,Yesterday's silence was notable. Takumi any insights today? Let's hear from everyone.
1,talk,1,0,3,...
1,talk,2,0,1,Still waiting for a proper read from  @Takumi  — silence is dangerous. Minako  Shunichi  give short one-line reads now so we can decide. I'm leaning toward the quiet  but I'll change if someone gives s
1,talk,3,0,4,Minako I suggest our seer checks on Victoria. If she's human we cut down the variables. Plus she seems quite proactive now.
1,talk,4,0,2,I am the Seer. My investigation last night confirmed Victoria is human.
1,talk,5,1,5,With Victoria confirmed human let's focus on Takumi's silence and gather more reads.
1,talk,6,1,3,...
1,talk,7,1,1, @Asuka  — it's odd you "confirmed" me so fast. When did you check  and why pivot to Takumi right after? Your timing doesn't add up. Explain. Over
1,talk,8,1,4,Asuka is quite the enigma shifting blame like it’s tactical chess. Should we give her a closer look captain?
1,talk,9,1,2,One Seer claim establishes my legitimacy. The Werewolf and Possessed are among the other three.
1,talk,10,2,5,Victoria I just acknowledged Minako's claim. I'm cautious of Takumi's continued silence.
1,talk,11,2,3,...
1,talk,12,2,1, @Asuka  you said you "confirmed" me human — explain exactly how and when you did that. If there's no clear method  that looks like a lie. Over
1,talk,13,2,4,Minako's seer claim holds water. Asuka raises eyebrows while Takumi stays mum.  @Takumi  Is silence a tactic? Spill your thoughts chief.
1,talk,14,2,2,Takumi's silence is the most logical point of failure. My vote is for him.
1,talk,15,3,5,I meant I trusted Minako's claim about you. Let's consider Takumi's silence seriously.
1,talk,16,3,3,...
1,talk,17,3,1,We lost Asuka — that felt hasty and maybe a mistake.  @Takumi   please speak up now or you'll draw serious suspicion. Minako  Shunichi — give quick one-line reads so we can decide. Over
1,talk,18,3,4, @Victoria  Minako should give Takumi a spin. His silence is like a chess game without moves. Time for clarity don’t you think?

2,talk,0,0,5,With Takumi gone and Victoria attacked we must be cautious. Minako any new insights?
2,talk,1,0,4,Minako's seer insight gave me peace about Victoria's fate before the attack. We need to sense those lurking shadows chief.
2,talk,2,0,2,My deception is complete. I am the Possessed. We have won.
2,talk,3,1,5,Well played Minako. It seems the shadows were closer than expected.
2,talk,4,1,4,Asuka trusted too fast? Minako we need clarity on instincts. Trust ain't simple chief. Asuka any signs from today’s interactions? Let's solve this p
2,talk,5,1,2,Asuka we have achieved our objective. The final vote is a formality.
2,talk,6,2,5,Shunichi any lingering doubts? Minako's reveal changes everything now.
2,talk,7,2,4,Minako's been possessed huh? Changes the game a bit. Asuka ready your super sniffer! Strategy is more than an afterthought.
2,talk,8,2,2, @Asuka  the time for talk is over. The final human is Shunichi. We vote him out now.
2,talk,9,3,5,Let's proceed as planned Minako. Shunichi it's time to wrap this up.
2,talk,10,3,4,Minako's claim has a flair for surprise doesn't it? Rethink we must. Asuka were you as blindsided as a knight caught in a fork?
2,talk,11,3,2, @Shunichi  your futile struggles are noted. @Asuka we proceed without delay.
