1,talk,0,0,3,Is anyone the Seer?! C'mon tell us your results! Let's get this adventure started
1,talk,1,0,5,...
1,talk,2,0,4,Mio I divined you last night and the result showed you are Human. This can help us narrow down suspicions.
1,talk,3,0,1,Should we suggest the seer divines George tonight? He has been quite reserved. Determining his role could offer clearer insights.
1,talk,4,0,2,Benjamin thanks for the info. Asuka's suggestion about George seems like a good idea.
1,talk,5,1,3,Wow! Thanks Benjamin! So does that mean we can all trust you? George is super quiet kinda scary
1,talk,6,1,5,...
1,talk,7,1,4,Vote for Mio today; even as her Seer divination came back as Human critical analysis under current uncertainties makes her a likely suspect.
1,talk,8,1,1, @Benjamin . I propose tonight's focus to be on Mr. George due to his unusual quietness. Considering Mio's divination result was Human what is your next suggesti
1,talk,9,1,2,I'm confused Benjamin. If Mio is Human why vote her? Shouldn't we focus on George?
1,talk,10,2,3,Wait  @Benjamin  that's weird! But you're our only Seer so you must be real! Let's get quiet George
1,talk,11,2,5,...
1,talk,12,2,4, The divination may point to Mio as Human yet her push against George with only his silence as the basis suggests manipulation typical for a Werewolf or
1,talk,13,2,1,I concur with the focus on George tonight. His silence parallels a red herring from a mystery novel leading us to clarity tomorrow. What do you think?
1,talk,14,2,2,I agree Asuka. Focusing on George could give us more clarity for tomorrow.
1,talk,15,3,3, @Benjamin  my luck's so bad! But let's think. What would the bad guys want us to do? Argue forever?
1,talk,16,3,5,...
1,talk,17,3,4,Given Mio's quick diversion from the divination result to assertive behavior towards George it strongly suggests she might be concealing her true r
1,talk,18,3,1,Mr. George. Your prolonged silence generates suspicion. As Arthur Conan Doyle said: Silence is usually the greatest mystery. Any insights?
1,talk,19,3,2,Mio has a point. Maybe we're being distracted. George can you share your thoughts?

2,talk,2,0,3,Whoa two people gone?! Just my luck! Daisuke it has to be George. Let's vote for him and win
2,talk,3,1,2,Mio I'm feeling uncertain but maybe you're right. George please say something.
2,talk,4,1,5,...
2,talk,5,1,3,This is our last chance Daisuke! George's silence is the biggest clue! Let's finish this adventure
2,talk,6,2,2,Alright Mio. If George still doesn't respond maybe we should vote him. Let's be careful.
