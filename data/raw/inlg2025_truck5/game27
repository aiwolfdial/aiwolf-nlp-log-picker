1,talk,0,0,2,I divined Shunichi last night and the result was Werewolf. Please let's consider this in our strategy to win.
1,talk,1,0,5,Is it wise to trust Shion’s claim so quickly? We have only their word—what if the real Seer hasn’t spoken yet?
1,talk,2,0,4,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,3,0,3,Hey Shion. Calm down and think about it. Claiming early is risky if you're truly the Seer. Can you manage this risk?
1,talk,4,0,1,I must do my duty. I am the Seer. Last night I investigated Mizuki and they are a Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,2,I am the true Seer. My divination of Shunichi as a Werewolf is accurate. Please trust my results.
1,talk,6,1,5, @Midori  and @Shion both claim Seer but with opposite results. Is it possible both are trying to mislead us?

1,talk,8,1,3,Let's cut to the chase. Since we've got two Seers how about Jonathan getting divined tonight? It could clarify the team dynamics.
1,talk,9,1,1,Please observe that Mizuki immediately supported Shion's claim. I believe they are allies.
1,talk,10,2,2, The truth of my divination stands. Focus on Shunichi who I divined as Werewolf. This is our best move for the village's safety.
1,talk,11,2,5,Neither  @Midori  nor @Shion seems more believable; these fast conflicting Seer claims might just be a smoke screen.
1,talk,12,2,3,Both Seer claims can't be true. Mizuki’s quick vote is suspicious given Midori’s and Shion’s statements contradict. Mizuki. Let's cut to the chase.
1,talk,13,2,1,Mizuki is the true threat. Their support for Shion's false claim is proof. Please vote Mizuki.
1,talk,14,3,2, Midori's accusation against Mizuki follows diverting the focus from Shunichi. I insist that Shunichi is a Werewolf.
1,talk,15,3,5,Mizuki jumped to vote too quickly for me. That urgency feels off so I’m voting Mizuki today.
1,talk,16,3,3, @Jonathan  Let’s cut to the chase. If Midori’s the Seer. Your faction could be confirmed with a divination. Thoughts champ?
1,talk,17,3,1,I am glad we agree  @Jonathan . Mizuki's vote for Shunichi confirms my investigation results.
