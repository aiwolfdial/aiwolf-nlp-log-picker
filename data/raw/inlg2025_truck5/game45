0,talk,2,0,3,Hello everyone! I'm Minato ready to dive into this game of mystery and strategy. Let's have fun and find that werewolf!
0,talk,3,0,5,I'm Ryuji. My approach is logical and direct. I'll claim Seer today. I'm the Seer awaiting my first vision result. @Shion  you urge brevity and role claims. I have no suspicions yet; I'm claiming Seer vision result comes tomorrow.

1,talk,1,0,2,Oh my gosh! Big bro I divined Ryuji as a Werewolf last night! Wow! Let's focus our votes on him and stay safe okay?
1,talk,2,0,1, @Ryuji  two people claim Seer but your stories don’t match. Can you explain more? If not we’ll just get more confused.
1,talk,3,0,5,I am the real Seer. Last night I divined Minato—Villager. If anyone else claims Seer they're a liar. @Mio If you're confused let's organize: I checked Minato last night and he is a Villager. Rin's claim is false.
1,talk,4,0,3,I divined Mio last night and confirmed she is human. With conflicting seer claims the wolves are sowing confusion. Let's stay calm and think this thro
1,talk,5,1,4, @Rin  You claimed Ryuji as Werewolf — explain how you divined him so confidently on Night 0. Your result directly conflicts with Ryuji and Minato’s checks.
1,talk,6,1,2,Wow! Hey big bro. I divined Ryuji and guess what? He's a Werewolf! So! Let's keep our cool when voting. It'll clear things up!
1,talk,7,1,1,Three Seer claims are wild—someone’s tricking us.  @Shion  you’re steering hard today. Why so decisive already?
1,talk,8,1,5,There are three Seer claims but only one can be telling the truth. Let's calmly sort through each claim rationally. @Minato  your Seer claim just added more doubt. Can you clarify when you decided to claim and why you checked Mio?
1,talk,9,1,3,Please vote for Ryuji today. Rin divined him as a Werewolf while he claimed I was human. This contradiction and urgency emphasize his danger. Let's se

1,talk,11,2,2,Let's vote for Ryuji! Oh my gosh big bro Minato do you think he's bluffing? I divined him as a Werewolf and he claimed you're a Villager!
1,talk,12,2,1,Three Seers is wild!  @Shion  who do you actually trust most right now? Any gut feeling besides the claimants?
1,talk,13,2,5,Three Seer claims mean someone is lying. My check on Minato showed Villager—no benefit in lying there. Stay logical. @Shion  your suspicion is valid but rash conclusions do not help. Examine motives behind the claims not only timing.
1,talk,14,2,3,It's crucial to think about the contradictions. Rin's divination of Ryuji as a Werewolf clashes with his own claim. This dispute points to Ryuji as th
1,talk,15,3,4,Let's organize: each person state (1) role claim  (2) night result if any  (3) who you're voting today.  @Minato  please restate your divination result and when you made your claim. Over
1,talk,16,3,2,Oh my gosh! Ryuji's acting just like a werewolf! Wow! Can you believe it? If we trust him. We'll be in big trouble. Let's vote Ryuji today!
1,talk,17,3,1,Honestly it’s chaos—Shion’s decisive moves could be a cover. I’m siding with my gut and voting Shion tonight.
1,talk,18,3,5,My stance remains clear: I am the Seer and Minato is innocent. Rash votes only help the real wolf hide. @Mio  you urge clarity so here's mine: I am the Seer and my check on Minato was intentional and timely. Stick to facts.
1,talk,19,3,3,Vote for Ryuji today. Both I and Rin have divination results pointing to him which increases his likelihood as a werewolf. Sticking to logical deduct

2,talk,0,0,1,Minato gave clear results from the start while Ryuji’s answers felt shaky. I’m leaning toward trusting Minato today.
2,talk,1,0,3,Ryuji's actions are suspect and Rin's divination strongly indicates him as the Werewolf. Aligning our votes against him is strategic for our surviv
2,talk,2,0,5,There are still inconsistencies in both Minato’s and Rin’s claims. Quick alignment feels rushed. Let’s review carefully. @Mio  you said my answers were shaky but Minato only copied Rin’s stance. Isn’t that equally suspect?
2,talk,3,1,1, @Ryuji  Minato’s Seer claim cleared me so logically you’re the one I suspect most and will vote for today.
2,talk,4,1,3,Ryuji divined me as Human but Rin identified him as the Werewolf. Considering their conflicting results and Shion's exile Ryuji's claim is dubious.
2,talk,5,1,5,With only one Werewolf and three Seer claims it's absurd to trust both Rin and Minato together. That logic is flawed. @Minato  you repeated Rin's claim after the fact. Why didn't you counter Ryuji's Seer claim immediately on Day 0?
2,talk,6,2,1,Minato cleared me with his divination so I trust him Ryuji’s claims just don’t feel consistent to me
2,talk,7,2,3,Ryuji's behavior increases suspicions given Rin's reliable divination. Voting for him secures our safety and upholds village interests.
2,talk,8,2,5,Minato’s sequence still doesn’t add up. Declaring after Rin and mirroring her result casts doubt on their intentions. @Mio  relying solely on Minato clearing you is risky—his Seer claim mirrors Rin’s narrative. Question the timing.
2,talk,9,3,1,Ryuji keeps trying to shift blame but Minato consistently claimed me as human. I have no reason to doubt him.
2,talk,10,3,3,Ryuji's claim is undermined by his inconsistent explanations while Rin's divination directly pointed to him as the Werewolf. Your vote is key for th
2,talk,11,3,5,Rin and Minato acting in tandem undermines trust. Their synchronized claims should be analyzed for coordination. @Minato Mirroring another Seer’s results post-fact isn’t logical Minato. Why the delay in your assertion relative to mine?
