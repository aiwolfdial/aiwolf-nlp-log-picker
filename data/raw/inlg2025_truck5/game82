0,talk,0,0,5,Glad to see everyone here! Let's play fair but stay sharp because I'm not letting any wolf get past us.
0,talk,1,0,2,Thanks  Takumi. I'm a bit nervous but I'll try to help. I don't have any clues—does anyone suspect someone already?  @Takumi  who do you think we should watch? Over
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello. I am Rin. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,3,0,4,If I may suggest. I am truly delighted to join this illustrious game. Shall we discuss questions and reveal clues to best the werewolves?
0,talk,4,0,3,Hi everyone! I'm Servas ready to play and strategize. Let's have some fun and figure out who the werewolf is!

0,talk,6,1,2, @Rin  You said you're a villager—why reveal so soon? Did you notice anything odd last night? I'm worried since we don't have clues yet. Over

0,talk,10,2,2,I still don't know who to trust... Can someone tell us if they saw anything strange last night?  @Takumi  who do you think we should consider for a vote? I'm a bit scared to pick someone without clues. Over
0,talk,11,3,2,I still don't have any clues. Can everyone say who they trust or why?  @Takumi  do you have anyone you suspect or any reason? If nobody gives a reason  maybe we should pick someone to watch closely before voting. Over

1,talk,0,0,1,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,1,0,5,I’ll come out—I’m the Seer. I checked  @Minato  last night. He’s Human.
1,talk,2,0,3, Thanks Takumi for sharing. It's very important we use this information wisely to protect the innocent.
1,talk,3,0,2,Thanks  Takumi. That makes me feel a bit safer  but I'm still uneasy about lynching someone without more proof.  @Servas  why do you trust Takumi? I don't want us to make a mistake. Over
1,talk,4,0,4,Ladies and gentlemen. If I may suggest. I must reveal my role as the Seer. Last night I divined Mr. Takumi. He is a Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,1,Over
1,talk,6,1,5, @Minato  trust my result—I revealed you as Human. Victoria is the fake Seer. Vote Victoria with me or we lose.
1,talk,7,1,3,Vote Takumi. Victoria has divined Takumi as a Werewolf and since I am the true Seer I support her claim. Trust us to lead us to victory.
1,talk,8,1,2,I'm really confused. There are two (no  three?) seer claims now — Takumi says he checked me (human)  Victoria says she checked Takumi (werewolf)  and Ser @Takumi  please tell us exactly when and how you checked me. Servas  why did you thank Takumi earlier and now claim seer? I don't want to vote without understandi
1,talk,9,1,4,Ladies and gentlemen. If I may suggest we have two individuals claiming the esteemed title of Seer. This warrants serious scrutiny.
1,talk,10,2,5, @Minato  you’re confirmed Human by my divination—please trust me and vote Victoria. Multiple late COs are never real.
1,talk,11,2,3, Listen carefully—I confirmed Takumi's duplicity. There isn't space for mistakes now. We must secure our village by removing the threat he poses.
1,talk,12,2,2,I'm really confused and a bit scared.  @Servas  you said you're the true Seer — when did you divine and who did you check? Takumi  when exactly did you check me and how did you report it? Victoria  why did y
1,talk,13,2,4,My dears. If I may suggest. Let us analyze this calmly. Two others claim Seer. Evidence leads to Mr. Takumi's guilt as Werewolf.  @Minato  It is indeed a conundrum. Assess all claims but I have divined that Mr. Takumi is a Werewolf. I implore your trust in this matter.
1,talk,14,3,5,@Minato  @Rin  Trust the first Seer result—fake claims pile up after. Victoria is the wolf. We must vote Victoria to win.
1,talk,15,3,3, I divined Takumi; he is not human. I didn't want to reveal too soon to avoid the werewolf's attack but we must act now.
1,talk,16,3,2,I'm still scared and confused.  @Takumi  — when exactly did you check me and how did you report it? Servas  you said you're the seer too — when did you divine and who did you check? Victoria  why did y
1,talk,17,3,4,Ladies and gentlemen. If I may suggest. We must unite against Takumi. His belated seer claim appears to be a wolf's desperate act!

2,talk,0,0,3, Rin I divined Minato as a Werewolf. He is deceiving us as you are the only other villager. Please vote Minato with us and save our village.
2,talk,1,0,1,I will vote Servas.

2,talk,3,1,3, Rin you must trust me. My divination shows Minato is the Werewolf. We need to vote him out to protect the village. Join me in voting him.

2,talk,5,1,2,I'm so sad...  @Servas  please tell us exactly who you divined and when — we need to know if your result was right. Rin  what do you think we should do now? I'm scared. Over
2,talk,6,2,3, Rin our village depends on us now. My divination confirmed Minato as the Werewolf. We must vote him out today for our safety.
2,talk,7,2,2,I'm so sad about Victoria...  @Servas  please tell us exactly who you divined and when — we need to know if your result was right. Rin  what do you think we should do now? I'm scared to decide. Ove
2,talk,8,3,3,  Rin to ensure our survival vote Minato out. He's proven a Werewolf through my divination. We can't afford to hesitate now.
2,talk,9,3,2,I'm so sad about Victoria...  @Servas  please tell us again who you divined and when — we need to know if your result matches. Rin  who do you think is suspicious now? I'm scared to choose alone.
