0,talk,0,0,1,Well met everyone I suggest we tackle today’s mysteries with clear minds and steady nerves no need for early panic.

0,talk,2,0,2,Hello everyone! I'm Servas ready to unravel the mystery with you all. Let's find the werewolf!
0,talk,3,0,3,Hey I'm Sakura! Can't wait to team up with you pal and crack the mystery of who the werewolf might be! It's gonna be awesome!

1,talk,0,0,2, Good to meet you all! Let's work together to ensure the villagers' safety tonight.
1,talk,1,0,3,Hey buddy! Guess what? I did a cool divination on Benjamin! He's Human so that means he's with the Villager Faction! Awesome right?
1,talk,2,0,4,I will vote Servas.
1,talk,3,0,1, @Misaki  you have been fairly quiet so far what do you think about Sakura’s divination and Benjamin’s early vote?
1,talk,4,0,5,This is a 1CO. If no one counters Sakura her data is reliable. The threat is you or Servas  @George .
1,talk,5,1,2, I suggest we vote for George today. Sakura's reliable divination shows Benjamin as Human eliminating him as a suspect.
1,talk,6,1,3,Hey buddy! With Misaki's awesome logic and Benjamin's cool divination let's divine George or Servas. We'll narrow down suspects!
1,talk,7,1,4,Over
1,talk,8,1,1, @Servas  you were quick to target me off Sakura’s CO—don’t you think that’s too easy? We should dig deeper.
1,talk,9,1,5,The logical target is one of the two unknowns George or Servas. Let us start with Servas.
1,talk,10,2,2,  Let's focus on reasoning. If Sakura's divination is reliable then Benjamin is safe. This leaves fewer suspects including George.
1,talk,11,2,3,Hey buddy! Misaki made an awesome point about two unknowns. Guess what? If we focus on George today we'll find out more!
1,talk,12,2,1,Servas jumped to blame me fast—maybe that’s just a wolf trying to survive. Should we really trust such quick accusations?
1,talk,13,2,5, @Benjamin  Your vote for Servas is a key data point. Explain your reasoning.
1,talk,14,3,2,  We must be wary of too quick to defend actions. George's hesitation could be a strategy to shift focus. Let's vote for George today.
1,talk,15,3,3,Hey buddy! George's quick callout of Servas feels like a cool mystery huh? If we're guessing both let's dive in and focus there!
1,talk,16,3,1,If we rush to convict me the wolf wins. I’m voting Servas—please reconsider before we hand victory to the wrong side.

2,talk,0,0,5,The wolf attacked Sakura confirming she was the Seer. Benjamin is human. I will vote for George.
2,talk,1,0,1, @Benjamin  trusting Sakura’s early Seer result is risky what if Misaki manipulated everything from the start?
2,talk,2,0,4,I will vote George.
2,talk,3,1,5,Your accusation lacks a logical basis George. The data confirms you are the final threat.
2,talk,4,1,1, @Benjamin  are you really just trusting Sakura’s word? What if Misaki slipped through as the real wolf all along?
2,talk,5,1,4,Over
2,talk,6,2,5,The data is conclusive George. Sakura was the Seer Benjamin is human. You are the only anomaly left.
2,talk,7,2,1, @Benjamin  if Misaki was the wolf and Sakura the possessed this neat result only creates a false sense of safety.
2,talk,8,3,5,George your Possessed theory contradicts the attack on Sakura. The logic points only to you.
2,talk,9,3,1,It’s too simple to accept the results as final—Misaki guided everyone and hid her intent I’ll vote Misaki.
