0,talk,1,0,5,Hey everyone I’m excited to play together Should we talk about how we want to start things off tomorrow?
0,talk,2,0,4,Good morning. I’ll stay quiet and gather info today.  @Kenji   did anyone seem off to you so far? I’ll watch how people speak and vote. Over
0,talk,3,0,3,Greetings everyone! I am Shion. It's a pleasure to collaborate and unravel this mystery together. Let's solve this with teamwork!

0,talk,7,1,4,Claiming "villager" right away is odd — that kind of early claim can be a setup.  @Minako   why announce your role so early? I'll listen before voting. Over

0,talk,10,2,4,An early role claim worries me.  @Minako  why announce now? If you can't give a good reason  I'll lean toward voting for you to force a reaction. Any objections? Over
0,talk,11,3,4,I don't want to lynch without cause  but that early role claim is suspicious.  @Minako  why reveal now? If you can't give a clear reason soon I'll vote for you. Over

1,talk,0,0,4, @Minako  please explain — why reveal villager so early? I don't like lynching without cause  but if you can't give a reasonable answer I'll keep my vote on you. An
1,talk,1,0,2,I divined Shion last night and the result showed that Shion is human. Let’s focus on finding the Werewolf elsewhere.
1,talk,2,0,5, I’m the Seer. Last night I divined  @Minako  and she is human. There’s only one real Seer here.
1,talk,3,0,3,Miss Shizue's assertion aligns with my own thoughts. With both Mr. Kenji and Miss Shizue claiming Seer status careful deliberation is essential.
1,talk,4,0,1,I will vote Kenji.
1,talk,5,1,4,Two seer claims — one of them must be false.  @Kenji   tell us exactly when you divined Minako and why you picked her. Minako  if Kenji says you're human  why are you voting him? I won't vote until someone give
1,talk,6,1,2,Everyone please vote for Minako today. I believe she is quite suspicious.
1,talk,7,1,5,Shizue is pushing to vote out Minako even after I declared her human that's what a real werewolf would do. Let's vote Shizue.
1,talk,8,1,3,With two Seer claims our priority is deciphering the truth of Shizue's and Kenji's words. Mr. George. Do Minako's actions post-Kenji's claim not rai

1,talk,10,2,4,Two seer claims is dangerous.  @Kenji  please say exactly when you divined Minako and why you think Shizue is the wolf — give a clear timeline. If you can't  I'll be suspicious of the claim. Ove
1,talk,11,2,2, Kenji's actions are suspicious. Divining Minako as human so quickly could be a tactic to protect a fellow Werewolf. Vote Minako to help ensure our saf
1,talk,12,2,5,I divined Minako on Night 0 and she’s human. Shizue is pushing to vote out a confirmed villager which seems wolf-like.
1,talk,13,2,3,Kenji divining Miss Minako as human brings uncertainty. Miss Shizue's claim aligns with my role. Identifying the true Seer is crucial.
1,talk,14,3,4,Two seer claims — one of them is lying. I'm leaning to trust  @Kenji . Kenji  when did you divinate Minako and why pick her? If you can't clarify soon I'll side with voting Shizue. Over
1,talk,15,3,2,Kenji's choice of divining Minako early and Minako voting Kenji suggests a strategy among Werewolves or the Possessed to create confusion. Vote Min
1,talk,16,3,5,I’m voting Shizue—she’s pushing to vote out a confirmed villager. That’s classic Werewolf strategy.
1,talk,17,3,3,Mr. Kenji's claim is bold as he targets Minako.packet. Yet it contradicts Seer's divination. Trusting him feels dangerous indeed. @Kenji Your divination of Miss Minako as human yet wanting to vote her is conflicting. What inspires your decision despite this puzzle?
