0,talk,4,0,5,I'm the Seer. I'll share my results tomorrow morning. I hope we can maintain a rational discussion. @Mizuki  could you elaborate on what you consider suspicious behavior in this context?

1,talk,0,0,1,It's early but let's keep observing everyone's behavior as we proceed. More interaction might give us clues.
1,talk,1,0,5,As I stated I am the Seer. Last night I divined Minato: the result was Human. Please share your thoughts. @Mizuki  since you value looking for inconsistencies do you find anything odd in the discussions so far?
1,talk,2,0,4,I feel okay for now since Asuka’s Seer result cleared me but I’d like to hear more from everyone especially Takumi.
1,talk,3,0,2,We need to figure out if Asuka is really a Seer or just bluffing. What do you say Daisuke? Is she playing a trick on us buddy?
1,talk,4,0,3,Asuka's claim seems solid for now. Let's hear more from Takumi to get a clearer picture.
1,talk,5,1,1,I suggest we all vote for Mizuki today. Let's focus on keeping the village safe.
1,talk,6,1,5,Daisuke's suggestion to vote for Mizuki seems abrupt and unsupported. We should examine his reasoning carefully. @Takumi  you questioned my Seer claim. What specifically leads you to doubt me at this stage?
1,talk,7,1,4, @Daisuke  why do you suspect Mizuki so soon? Did anything stand out to you last night that we missed?
1,talk,8,1,2,Hey Asuka. It's not doubt. It's being cautious. That Seer claim came early. We need proof. Let's stay on guard pal!
1,talk,9,1,3,Daisuke can you explain your reasoning for voting me? Let's ensure our decisions are sound.
1,talk,10,2,1,Considering Asuka's divination points to Minato as Human with Mizuki questioning discussions without concrete reasons rouses suspicion.
1,talk,11,2,5,Daisuke your logic for targeting Mizuki appears tenuous. Unsubstantiated votes undermine credibility. @Daisuke You seem focused on Mizuki with little basis. Please clarify the evidence supporting your suspicion.
1,talk,12,2,4,Daisuke’s push on Mizuki seems rushed. Shouldn’t we slow down and check everyone’s behavior before deciding?
1,talk,13,2,2,Daisuke is rushing. Targeting Mizuki without clear proof isn't right. Let's slow down and check everyone's actions carefully.
1,talk,14,2,3,Let's focus on gathering more information before making rushed decisions. Clarity is key.
1,talk,15,3,1,Asuka's divination showed Minato as Human which clears him leaving fewer suspects. Reviewing interactions Mizuki's approach has been vague.
1,talk,16,3,5,Daisuke's persistent emphasis on Mizuki is concerning and may indicate an ulterior motive. Caution is warranted. @Mizuki Your approach has been methodical Mizuki. Do you discern any inconsistencies between Daisuke's actions and his stated logic?
1,talk,17,3,4,Everyone’s acting fast but we need clarity. I’ll vote Mizuki now since Daisuke pushed most for it. Hope it leads somewhere.
1,talk,18,3,2,Asuka claiming Seer early isn't unusual but needs verifying. Relying just on statements is risky. What do you think Minato? We can do this but Asuka's
1,talk,19,3,3,Daisuke's focus on me seems unsubstantiated. Let's keep our analysis balanced and thorough.

2,talk,0,0,4,I trust Asuka’s Seer result so for me it’s between @Mizuki and  @Takumi . Who do you feel is acting off today?
2,talk,1,0,3,Minato I'm cautious about Takumi's silence. Let's gather more insights before deciding.
2,talk,2,0,2,Minato let's use Asuka's divination claim wisely. We can plan our next move based on her insights. Leave it to me pal!
2,talk,3,1,4,If we trust Asuka’s divination then it’s just between @Mizuki and  @Takumi . Who seems more suspicious to you right now?
2,talk,4,1,3,Minato I'm still evaluating Takumi's actions. Let's stay objective and observe further.
2,talk,5,1,2,Asuka being attacked! Wolves might fear her divination. Minato should we focus on Mizuki more? She seems uncertain.  @Mizuki  How are you holding up Mizuki? Asuka's death changed things. Noticed any new thoughts today?
2,talk,6,2,4, @Takumi  Mizuki always says let's be objective but never decides. Does that seem odd to you?
2,talk,7,2,3,I'm holding up Takumi. Still analyzing our actions. We must tread carefully and wisely.
2,talk,8,2,2,Mizuki's hesitance worries me. Asuka's true side isn't clear yet. We must be cautious! Let's weigh our moves carefully!
2,talk,9,3,4, @Takumi  I agree Mizuki is too hesitant. It feels intentional. I’ll vote Mizuki today. Let’s trust Asuka’s claim.
2,talk,10,3,3,Minato my approach is cautious not hesitant. Let's ensure our decisions are informed.
2,talk,11,3,2,Daisuke's vote-out smells of a wolf move. Mizuki's caution might hide a secret. Let's act fast. Minato. Trust your instincts buddy!
