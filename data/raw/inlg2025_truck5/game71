0,talk,2,0,4,Hi I'm Minato. I will come out as Seer if that's okay. No results yet. Share first thoughts. Who feels safe or strange? @Yumi  if it's okay could you share one thought? Who do you want to talk with first? Thank you.
0,talk,3,0,1,Good morning everyone let’s keep our eyes sharp today—little details always seem to matter most right at the start
0,talk,4,0,5,I am the seer.  @Minato  claimed seer — this is a role conflict. Reveal your divination result or justification now. If no proof  Minato becomes highly suspicious. I will divi

1,talk,0,0,1, @Minato  your silence makes it hard to trust—can you share your divination or thoughts now?
1,talk,1,0,2,Minato and Takumi! Did your magic peeks see anything last night? Tell us! Yumi is getting antsy
1,talk,2,0,3,I divined last night and found that Victoria is the werewolf. We should discuss this further for our safety.
1,talk,3,0,5,I divined Yumi last night — she is a werewolf. Vote Yumi.  @George  you claimed divination finding Victoria werewolf; reveal your result or be treated as a fake. Over
1,talk,4,0,4,Skip
1,talk,5,1,1, @George  You say I’m werewolf but I know I’m villager—why lie? Shouldn’t we vote for the one spreading clear falsehoods?
1,talk,6,1,2,Takumi told a big fib because Yumi is a good guy. George must be a fibber too. Lets vote for Takumi.
1,talk,7,1,3,I am the true Seer and my divination result shows Victoria as the werewolf. Please trust in my ability and judgment.
1,talk,8,1,5,I divined  @Yumi  last night — she is a werewolf. Vote her. Over
1,talk,9,1,4,Good morning. I am Seer. I checked Takumi last night: werewolf. Please stay calm. What do you think? @Victoria  sorry I was late. My result is Takumi wolf. Does that help? Any thoughts please?
1,talk,10,2,1,George's seer claim is false since I’m villager. He’s my top suspect now—is anyone else convinced he’s not the real seer?
1,talk,11,2,2,Takumi lied about Yumi! He's a baddie for sure! Let's vote him out now! Da-da-da
1,talk,12,2,3, I stand by my divination. Victoria is the werewolf. I urge everyone to focus and vote correctly for our survival.
1,talk,13,2,5,I am the seer. I divined  @Yumi  last night — she is a werewolf. Vote her. Over

1,talk,15,3,1,Takumi’s claims don’t fit the facts—Minato gives the most credible result. I’m voting Takumi. Will anyone join me?
1,talk,16,3,2,Yay Victoria agrees! Let's all vote for Takumi! He's a big fibber for sure
1,talk,17,3,3, Takumi and Minato conflicting claims create confusion. Trust my earlier divination; Victoria is the werewolf. Vote wisely.
1,talk,18,3,5,I am the seer. I divined  @Yumi  last night — she is a werewolf. Vote her. Over

2,talk,0,0,1,George is clearly lying about me—his claim makes no sense. Minato your divination matched reality and has my trust.
2,talk,1,0,3, Minato your claim as Seer conflicts with my results. I divined that Victoria is a werewolf. Please trust me and vote for Victoria.
2,talk,2,0,4,Skip
2,talk,3,1,1,George is pushing a false result—Minato  your logic fits the facts. I’m certain George is the werewolf here.
2,talk,4,1,3, Minato you are not the real Seer. I am. I've confirmed Victoria as the werewolf. Please listen and let's exile Victoria today for our own safety.
2,talk,5,1,4,Skip
2,talk,6,2,1,George is claiming I’m the werewolf but I know I’m innocent—Minato this makes George the true wolf here. Let’s vote him out.
2,talk,7,2,3, Minato please understand that my divination was accurate; Victoria is definitely the werewolf. We need to vote for her today.
2,talk,8,2,4,Skip
2,talk,9,3,1,George’s claim is false—I’m voting George as the werewolf.  @Minato  let’s trust your results and save the village.
2,talk,10,3,3, My divination revealed Victoria as the werewolf. Don't be swayed by her defense. I am the real Seer. Vote for Victoria for our safety.
2,talk,11,3,4,I will vote George today. Takumi's claim was false and Yumi was attacked. George's tale feels odd I think. Is that okay? @George  if you're Seer why keep Victoria alive? I'm voting you now sorry. What do you think?
