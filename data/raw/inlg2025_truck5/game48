0,talk,0,0,2,Hello everyone! I'm Shunichi ready to outsmart and uncover werewolves among us. Let's have a thrilling game!
0,talk,1,0,5,Hi Shunichi... I'm not great at talking  so I'll mostly listen. But  @Asuka 's calmness makes me uneasy — any role claims or reads from others? Over
0,talk,2,0,3,Greetings everyone. Let's work together and trust our instincts to find the truth.
0,talk,3,0,4,Good evening everyone. I hope our quiet town can avoid chaos tonight.
0,talk,4,0,1,I'm the Seer. I will share my first divination result tomorrow morning. @Daisuke  my attitude comes from focusing on logic not from hiding something. No reads yet.
0,talk,5,1,2,Over
0,talk,6,1,5,Thanks for claiming   @Asuka . I appreciate it  but I'm still uneasy—can someone else state their role or any reads? I want more info before deciding. Over

0,talk,10,2,5,I'm still uneasy.  @Asuka   if you're really the seer  why wait until tomorrow to reveal? I need more than claims—any villager role claims or reads? I don't want us to rush a vote. Ov
0,talk,11,2,3,I understand your concern Daisuke. Let's give Asuka time to gather information wisely.
0,talk,12,3,5,I still don't feel right about  @Asuka 's claim. Could you explain why you're waiting until tomorrow to reveal? I can't bring myself to vote yet. Over
0,talk,13,3,3,Let's allow Asuka to explain; patience is our ally in revealing the truth.

1,talk,0,0,4, @Asuka  could you share your divination result? We need it to guide our vote before suspicions take root.
1,talk,1,0,3,Asuka your insight would be invaluable now; let's move forward with clarity.
1,talk,2,0,2,I divined last night and Daisuke is a Werewolf. We should consider this seriously for our safety.
1,talk,3,0,5,I'm really shaken by  @Shunichi 's divination saying I'm a werewolf. That's a big claim — please explain how you checked me. We should wait for the seer's result before lynching anyon
1,talk,4,0,1,My divination result: Shunichi is the werewolf. This contradicts Shunichi's claim on Daisuke. @Shunichi  your claim about Daisuke is noted but my result indicates you are the werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,4,With two Seer claims giving opposite results we need to choose. I lean toward trusting Asuka right now. Thoughts  @Servas ?
1,talk,6,1,3,It's a tough call Jonathan. Trusting Asuka seems wise but we need to deliberate carefully.
1,talk,7,1,2, My divination is accurate I'm the real Seer. Trust my results concerning Daisuke. We need to ensure our safety.
1,talk,8,1,5,I'm really shaken by  @Shunichi 's divination saying I'm a werewolf. If you're really the seer  why didn't you reveal this sooner? Please explain when/how you checked. Others  please
1,talk,9,1,1,Given there are two Seer claims it is logical to assume one is lying. Deliberate on voting between Shunichi and Daisuke. @Daisuke  if you are not the wolf explain your reaction to Shunichi's claim in detail. Your defensiveness stands out.
1,talk,10,2,4, @Servas  your neutrality stands out. Between Asuka and Shunichi who do you trust more right now? Please share your view.
1,talk,11,2,3,I lean towards trusting Asuka but we must weigh all actions and words carefully.
1,talk,12,2,2, Focus on the facts. My divination showed Daisuke as a Werewolf. It's crucial we address this for the village's safety.
1,talk,13,2,5, @Shunichi  You said you divined me as Werewolf — how exactly did you check me and why wait to reveal? I don't want to be lynched on one claim. Can others share any chec
1,talk,14,2,1,These Seer claims conflict. One is likely lying. Pay close attention to Shunichi's tone and Daisuke's reactions. @Daisuke  you focus on defending yourself instead of analyzing others. What's your reasoning?
1,talk,15,3,4,Asuka’s clarity convinces me. I’ll vote Shunichi tonight; unity matters if we want to protect our village.
1,talk,16,3,3,Let's stay focused and listen carefully. A united decision is our best path forward.
1,talk,17,3,2, I stand by my reading; Daisuke is a werewolf threatening our village. I urge everyone to consider this seriously.
1,talk,18,3,5, @Shunichi  You said you divined me last night—please explain exactly when and how you checked and how you confirmed the result. There's another seer claim too  so
1,talk,19,3,1,Focus on the contradiction between Shunichi and me. Both can't be Seer. Review motives and consistency. @Servas  I appreciate your trust but please objectively scrutinize both our claims before voting.

2,talk,0,0,3,With Jonathan gone let's stay vigilant. Asuka any new insights from last night?
2,talk,1,0,5,I'm shaken by Shunichi's execution and Jonathan being attacked.  @Asuka  please reveal your divination now — we need that to avoid lynching the wrong person. I don't want to rush  but it's urgent. Over
2,talk,2,0,1,I'll report my result: Servas is a villager. I recommend focusing on Daisuke for today. @Daisuke My divination shows Servas as villager. That leaves your alignment highly questionable for me. Please explain yourself.
2,talk,3,1,3,Asuka thank you. Daisuke clarify your stance; openness helps us find the truth.
2,talk,4,1,5,I'm really sorry about Shunichi and Jonathan.  @Asuka  you claimed seer but haven't shown a result — with Shunichi gone and his check on me  could you reveal your divination now? We need clarity before voting
2,talk,5,1,1,Shunichi's claim was false. My check says Servas is a villager so Daisuke is probably the last wolf here. @Daisuke  you push for clarity after Shunichi lied. Is this deflection or do you have something useful to add?
2,talk,6,2,3,Daisuke your actions and words can clarify the situation; transparency is vital now.
2,talk,7,2,5,This is getting messy. Two seer claims and Shunichi's execution make me uneasy.  @Asuka  you claimed seer but still haven't shown your result — please reveal now  or I'll have to vote to protect the town. Over
2,talk,8,2,1,Daisuke's constant demands for my divination after doubting me before ring hollow. Consistency is lacking in his stance. @Daisuke You keep requesting my divination but your tone shifts frequently. Are you seeking truth or casting distractions?
2,talk,9,3,3,Let's focus on consistency and logic Daisuke. Your next words are crucial for clarity.
2,talk,10,3,5,I hate to push this  but  @Asuka  claimed seer and still won't show a result after Shunichi checked me. That silence feels like hiding something. I’m leaning to vote Asuka to be safe. A
2,talk,11,3,1,Daisuke's approach is inconsistent. He doubted my Seer claim then pressured me for results. That pattern is suspicious. @Servas  observe Daisuke's changing tactics: first doubting now demanding. Does this read as genuine to you?
