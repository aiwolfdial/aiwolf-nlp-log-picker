0,talk,0,0,3,Um... hello I’m Daisuke. Uh I just want everyone to know I’m just a simple villager. Um please be gentle with me...
0,talk,1,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm Yumi ready to howl and play! Let's have some fun and figure out who's who!
0,talk,2,0,2,Hello. I am Shion. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,3,0,4,Hey folks! Shunichi here. Just an average villager trying to root out the werewolf among us. Let’s crack this case together!
0,talk,4,0,5,Shion’s seer claim is a big move this early. Shion  who did you check and what was the result? If you won’t reveal  give us why we should trust you.  @Daisuke  what’s your read on Shion? Over

0,talk,9,1,5,We need something concrete  not just greetings.  @Daisuke  you said you’re a simple villager and then fell silent — that’s suspicious. Shion  if you truly are seer  please give at least one check to guide us. Absen
0,talk,10,2,5,Shion’s seer claim still has no details — that’s dangerous.  @Daisuke  what do you think? If Shion won’t show a check  I’d rather put them up for a vote today than wait. I’m leaning to nominate Shion. Over
0,talk,11,3,5,We can’t dither. Shion claimed seer and gave no result — dangerous silence. I’ll vote Shion unless someone shows proof.  @Daisuke  do you agree? Over

1,talk,0,0,1, I divined Shion last night and found out Shion is the Werewolf. We need to address this.
1,talk,1,0,3,Um Yumi came out as seer now... It's confusing isn't it? Shion and Yumi both can't be seer... @Servas  you pushed Shion a lot yesterday. May I ask what you think about Yumi's sudden seer claim?
1,talk,2,0,5,If Yumi actually divined Shion  that explains the late claim. Shion gave no result and their earlier seer claim was empty — that’s worrying. I’ll trust @Daisuke  will you join? Over
1,talk,3,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Shunichi and Shunichi was a human.
1,talk,4,0,4,Trust Yumi for now. Shion's tales? Not persuasive enough. Best play is to stay sharp and see how this chess game unfolds.
1,talk,5,1,1, I apologize for the confusion earlier. I'm not the Seer; I claimed so to observe reactions. Now I believe Shion might be risky due to silence and vague c
1,talk,6,1,3,Oh um... things got confusing fast. Yumi admitted her claim wasn’t true so... should we focus on Shion’s result? @Shion  if it’s alright... um why did you check Shunichi instead of anyone else? Was there a reason?
1,talk,7,1,5,Shion  that result matters — when did you check Shunichi and was it last night? Yumi admitting a fake seer claim is suspicious too.  @Daisuke  with Shion giving a concrete check now  who do you trust? I’m not ready to lynch without clearer reads. Over
1,talk,8,1,2,I will vote Servas.
1,talk,9,1,4,Yumi. Nice play claiming Seer. Risky but fun. Got our attention. Still think Shion's guilty? Or got a new plan up your sleeve?
1,talk,10,2,1, Let's focus and vote for Shion today. I divined him as the Werewolf and the situation aligns with his earlier silence and vague claims.
1,talk,11,2,3,Um... I'm still unsure. Yumi admitting to a fake claim makes trusting her hard but Shion's result is also... vague. @Servas Sorry Servas... I'm not really sure who to trust yet. Do you have a strong reason for picking Shion over Yumi?
1,talk,12,2,5,Good question   @Daisuke . I pushed Shion before because an early seer claim with no result is textbook chaos. Now that Shion gave a check  that weakens my case against them. Yumi
1,talk,13,2,2,I will vote Servas.
1,talk,14,2,4,Let's cut to the chase. With Shion's checks and Yumi pulling the seer act we need clarity. So who gets the divination spotlight tonight?
1,talk,15,3,1,  Trust me this round. My earlier claim was risky but it brought some much needed clarity. Vote Shion. His responses and silence are too risky for us if we
1,talk,16,3,3,Um... I'm really not sure who the real seer is. Both sides look... confusing. I want to hear more before I decide. @Yumi  your fake seer claim made things hard to follow. Why did you think that would help us find the werewolf?
1,talk,17,3,5,Old age taught me patience — don't rush a lynch. If anyone has night info  speak now. Yumi  please explain why you pretended to be the seer and if you saw any @Daisuke  what's your honest read now? I prefer waiting for clear evidence before voting. Over
1,talk,18,3,2,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,19,3,4,We need to focus on who's honest. Yumi came clean about her fake claim. Trust her now? Tricky right?  @Daisuke  Stay sharp. What's your instinct on the real seer's identity?

2,talk,0,0,4,Alright. With Yumi gone and my seer status confirmed thanks to Shion's divine exit let's zero in on the wolf now.
2,talk,1,0,3,Um... I'm not sure who to trust now. Yumi admitted lying but Shion's divination was unclear too... @Shunichi S-sorry Shunichi but how exactly was your seer status confirmed? I feel uncertain about that...
2,talk,2,0,5,This is grim — Shion executed and Yumi attacked. Wolves often strike claimers; town needs concrete info now.  @Daisuke  you were quiet yesterday — what’s your read and any night info? If no one has proof  I’ll vote whoever can’t explain themselves. Over
2,talk,3,1,4,Hey Daisuke. Shion nailed my villager status. So can we suspect Servas is dodgy? I'm curious about your perspective.
2,talk,4,1,3,I... I don't really have any night info to share. I still think Shion and Yumi's claims are both confusing. Uh... @Servas Sorry Servas. I didn't get any special info last night. I'm really just a villager and not sure what to look for.
2,talk,5,1,5,A heavy toll last night — we lost Shion and Yumi. We must be deliberate now.  @Daisuke  you were quiet — do you have any night info or a role to share? If not  explain why we should trust you; otherwise I may have to vote you to force clarity. Oth
2,talk,6,2,4,If Shion's telling the truth since I divined as human let's keep an eye on Daisuke or Servas. We need more insight here.
2,talk,7,2,3,I know I've been quiet... I'm just a villager. Who do you all think is suspicious? @Shunichi  why do you trust Shion's divination so much even with those vague answers?
2,talk,8,2,5,These losses leave us little time.  @Daisuke   if you truly have a role or night info  please reveal it now — otherwise I’ll have to vote you to force clarity. Shunichi  what are your reads if you won’t re
2,talk,9,3,4,Shion divined me human. Trust her. Servas could be bluffing. Let's vote Servas if roles are uncertain. Servas. Reflect on those pressure tactics. We
2,talk,10,3,3,Um it's hard for me to decide... Shunichi says he's trustworthy but Servas keeps pushing hard. I feel lost honestly. @Servas S-sorry Servas... I don’t have new info. I’m really just a villager so I don’t know how to be more helpful right now.
2,talk,11,3,5,We lost two claimers — that’s costly. Town needs clarity now.  @Daisuke  you’ve been quiet and under suspicion — reveal your role or give concrete reads  or I’ll vote you to force a decision. Shunichi  what do you think? Others
