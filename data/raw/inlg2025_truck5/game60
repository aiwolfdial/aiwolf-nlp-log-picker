0,talk,0,0,5,Hello. I am Benjamin. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,1,0,1,Hey there silly gooses! I'm Mio and super pumped to play with you all. Let's rock this game and have epic chats okay?
0,talk,2,0,4,Hello everyone, I'm Midori ready to howl and play! Can't wait to start this mysterious adventure with you all. Let's have fun!
0,talk,3,0,2,Hi Benjamin  you said you're the seer.  @Benjamin  could you tell us your divination result? I'm still learning about roles so I want to understand. Midori  Mio — do you believe him or have any suspicions

0,talk,10,2,2, @Benjamin  Please tell us who you divined and what the result was — I'm still not sure who to trust. Daisuke seemed calm too; does anyone else find that odd? Over

0,talk,12,3,2, @Benjamin  please reveal your divination result now — we really need info. Daisuke's calmness makes me a little suspicious. Midori Mio  what do you think? I'm onl

1,talk,0,0,3,Good morning everyone. How are we feeling? Any thoughts on what Benjamin shared?
1,talk,1,0,5,I am a seer. I divined Minato and Minato was a human.
1,talk,2,0,4, I need to share that I am the actual Seer and I divined Benjamin who turned out to be a Werewolf. Please consider this.
1,talk,3,0,1,Hey BFF listen up! I'm the real Seer! I divined Benjamin and guess what? He's Human! We've gotta rethink what Midori said and hunt for that pesky Werewo
1,talk,4,0,2,I'm really confused.  @Benjamin  you said you divined me as human — when did you check and could you be sure? Midori and Mio both claim seer but they say opposite things about you. Midori  M
1,talk,5,1,3,This is really confusing. Can we discuss more to find out who's telling the truth?
1,talk,6,1,5,I will vote Midori.
1,talk,7,1,4, I insist my vision was clear. Benjamin is the Werewolf. Trust in my divination is crucial for our victory.
1,talk,8,1,1,Midori's all talk without any proof feels kinda shady! Let's dive into her chatter and see if there's a clue to her true role!
1,talk,9,1,2,I'm really confused.  @Midori  when exactly did you divinate Benjamin? Benjamin and Mio say he's human  so your result doesn't fit — can you explain the timing or why you trust your vis
1,talk,10,2,3,Midori can you explain more? We're trying to figure out who to believe here.

1,talk,12,2,4,  My divination was precise; Benjamin is not what he claims. My role and my results are sincere. Trust is essential to win this game.
1,talk,13,2,1,Minato. Let's hit those logic gears. Two seers? No way! One's fibbing right?  @Daisuke . Maybe Midori's just bluffing? Keep an eye on her!
1,talk,14,2,2,Good morning. I'm worried because more than one person claimed seer earlier.  @Benjamin  could you explain when you did your check and who you checked? I want to understand before we vote. Over
1,talk,15,3,3,This is getting intense. We need more clarity to avoid making a wrong decision.
1,talk,16,3,4,  Remain alert. I must stress the importance of my divination - it's crucial to identify the correct threat. Benjamin as Werewolf aligns with my findin
1,talk,17,3,1,Hey BFF! Like if Benjamin's really human then why's he trying so hard to sway votes against Midori? Total werewolf panic right?
1,talk,18,3,2,Good morning everyone. Did anyone get attacked last night?  @Daisuke  you seemed very calm before — can you share who you trust or what you think we should do today? Midori Mio Benjamin — any role claims or suspicions? I'm no
