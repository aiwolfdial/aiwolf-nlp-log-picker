1,talk,0,0,5,Did anyone notice anything strange during the night? We need to stay alert today.
1,talk,1,0,2, Keep focused everyone. Clear thinking leads to uncovering the truth. Let's make the right decisions today.

1,talk,3,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Toshio and Toshio was a human.
1,talk,4,0,4,A lone Seer revealing a human. How quaintly straightforward. I was hoping for more drama.
1,talk,5,1,5,Thanks for sharing Asuka. Let's gather more information and be strategic about our next steps.
1,talk,6,1,2,I must clarify I am the actual Seer here. I divined Daisuke last night and he is the Werewolf.
1,talk,7,1,3,...
1,talk,8,1,1,I will vote Daisuke.
1,talk,9,1,4,A tale of two seers. Their stories clash but their verdict aligns on Daisuke.
1,talk,10,2,5,With both seers naming Daisuke it seems we should focus our attention there today.
1,talk,11,2,2, We need to act on this clear evidence against Daisuke. Trust my divination; he poses a risk to the village.
1,talk,12,2,3,...
1,talk,13,2,1,I will vote Daisuke.
1,talk,14,2,4,Two seers one verdict. How simple. My vote goes to Daisuke to hasten the finale.
1,talk,15,3,5,With both seers agreeing it's wise to go with the evidence and vote for Daisuke today.
1,talk,16,3,2, Make the right choice vote for Daisuke. He's the Werewolf and we must protect our village from danger.

2,talk,0,0,5,It's a shame we lost Asuka. Toshio any insights from last night to guide us today?
2,talk,1,0,2,Vote for Mizuki. It's crucial. Based on our discussions Mizuki seems very likely to be the Werewolf.
2,talk,2,0,4,Toshio speaks the truth. Our delightful game ends with you Mizuki.
2,talk,3,1,5,Toshio your claim seems sudden. What's your evidence against me? Let's discuss this.
2,talk,4,1,2,Vote Mizuki. After losing Asuka Mizuki's urgency and questions are suspicious. Our prior divinations have revealed nothing against her allowing f
2,talk,5,1,4,Fufu. The numbers are on our side Mizuki. This delightful game is already over.
2,talk,6,2,5,May don't be too hasty. Let's ensure we're making the right decision with solid evidence.
2,talk,7,2,2,Vote Mizuki today. She's not been forthcoming her behaviour is more aggressive than typical and no evidence points to her innocence.
2,talk,8,2,4, @Mizuki  Evidence is for when the little humans still have a chance. Fufu.
2,talk,9,3,5,I urge everyone to think carefully. We need to be sure before making a critical decision.
2,talk,10,3,2,Vote Mizuki. Her insistence and strategic shifts point to her role as the Werewolf. Aligning votes against her maximizes our safety.
2,talk,11,3,4,Your pleas are music to my ears little lamb. Alas I am the wolf and the game is won.
