1,talk,0,0,2,I will vote Shizue.
1,talk,1,0,5,Good morning all! Guess what my Seer powers sparkled last night—I checked Kenji and he’s Human! Phew right? @Shizue Hey Shizue you were a bit quiet about your role yesterday! Are you hiding a secret or just playing it safe? Teehee~
1,talk,2,0,4,Whoa wait! I'm the real Seer! I checked Mizuki and she's the werewolf! I've got a bad feeling about this
1,talk,3,0,1, @Kenji  you’re calling me the werewolf but I know I’m a villager. Why should we trust your claim over Sakura’s?
1,talk,4,0,3,Ah dear ones. Two seer claims we face it seems. Kenji divined Mizuki. Sakura divined Kenji. Let's discuss this further yes?
1,talk,5,1,2,I will vote Shizue.
1,talk,6,1,5,Whoa it's lively! Kenji you're Seer too? Double vision or trouble? Let's clear this mist! @Kenji  did you reveal now because I claimed Seer or was it always your plan? Spill the beans!
1,talk,7,1,4,Whoa two Seers! This means one is real and one's a Possessed! I'm the real one team
1,talk,8,1,1, @Servas  you keep targeting Shizue but avoid the Seer claims. What’s your real reason? Who do you actually suspect most?
1,talk,9,1,3, @Servas  My dear I am puzzled by your choice to vote for me repeatedly. Shall we focus instead on the seer dilemma Kenji or Sakura?
1,talk,10,2,2,Over
1,talk,11,2,5,Two Seers now interesting! If Kenji’s Seer why not come out sooner? Feels a bit suspicious don’t you think? @Mizuki  you seem really sure Kenji’s wrong. If you were just a villager would you be that confident? Or just nervous?
1,talk,12,2,4,Okay think about it! The werewolf wants us to be confused. My result clears things up! Mizuki is the baddie
1,talk,13,2,1,Kenji claims I’m wolf but I know I’m Villager. Doesn’t his CO seem oddly timed right after Sakura’s statement?
1,talk,14,2,3,Oh my dear. Sakura's words come from a kind place. Kenji. though. his timing surely makes us wonder. What do you think. child?
1,talk,15,3,5,Everybody! If I'm the real Seer and Kenji's fake then Mizuki and I can't both be wolves! Want to trust my sparkling vision? @Shizue  you’re calm as a river! If you had to pick one Seer to trust who gives your heart the sunniest glow? Just curious~
1,talk,16,3,4,Servas's vote for Shizue is confusing! My vision pointed right at Mizuki! She's the baddie
1,talk,17,3,1,Kenji’s seer claim feels forced and aimed straight at me just after Sakura CO’d. I trust Sakura more so my vote is Kenji.
1,talk,18,3,3,If we trust Sakura. There's a risk we lose. Aren't we? Timing and sudden seer claim don't sit well with me. She seems slippery. Yes? @Kenji Kenji my dear child. Your seer reveal after sweet Sakura spoke seemed like she foresaw your truth first. What are your thoughts?

2,talk,0,0,3,My dear. With Kenji gone and Servas attacked. Sakura must be the Seer then. Let's focus. Might someone be aiding Mizuki? Shall we secure our votes. Yes
2,talk,1,0,1, @Shizue  you haven’t CO’d or stated your suspect clearly. Are you hiding something? Please tell us your role and target now.
2,talk,2,0,5,Alright! Kenji made things wild with that fake Seer act but my power’s clear right? I checked Mizuki—100% human! @Shizue Oh Shizue your cool head is awesome! But if Kenji faked and Servas is out what do you think about Mizuki and me now?
2,talk,3,1,3, @Sakura  Sweet one. If your divination has shown Mizuki is clear. Should you divine me next to reassure and bring peace?
2,talk,4,1,1, @Shizue  Sakura’s result points at you. Why won’t you CO? If you’re not werewolf explain yourself directly.
2,talk,5,1,5,Whew yesterday felt wild but it’s sunny now! Shizue just say it—are you a villager or not? @Mizuki  you’re bold! If Shizue dodges again guess who acts wolfy? Let’s stay sharp teehee!
2,talk,6,2,3,Oh sweet one. With our dear Sakura as the Seer Kenji's claim tumbles like autumn leaves. Isn't it delightful that Mizuki is clear?
2,talk,7,2,1, @Shizue  Why won’t you CO your role at this point? Silence is more suspicious than any Seer result.
2,talk,8,2,5,It's the final puzzle now friends! With Kenji gone my two divinations are full-on sunshine—Kenji and Mizuki are both human! @Shizue  your words are always gentle but why won't you say your role? That hush is making my whiskers twitch with curiosity!
2,talk,9,3,3,Dear ones. Sakura's timing and claims truly worry me. If we err by trusting her. We risk everything. Is it not too smooth? @Sakura Oh my dear. I sigh and find it curious how swiftly you've gained such trust. Do your claims hold truth? Or are we mere puppets?
2,talk,10,3,1,It’s clear. Sakura’s Seer CO checks out.  @Shizue  you’re the only one evading trust. I’m voting you out.
2,talk,11,3,5,Whoa Shizue your questions sparkle but the dodging is a brain teaser! I'm loving it—what's your secret? @Shizue  your talk is like a riddle! Will you just say villager or wolf—no more suspense please?
