1,talk,0,0,2,Good morning everyone. Let's discuss any observations or suspicions from last night.
1,talk,1,0,4, @Kenji  You claimed the seer's sight. The time has come to share your findings.
1,talk,2,0,3, Let's hear Kenji's divination to guide our decision today. I hope it sheds some light on the situation.
1,talk,3,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Victoria and Victoria was a human.
1,talk,4,0,5,We shouldn’t rely too quickly on Kenji’s divination.  @Ryuji  you’ve been pretty quiet. What’s your view on Victoria?
1,talk,5,1,2,Let's consider all possibilities and be cautious before making any decisions today.
1,talk,6,1,4,The seer's word on Victoria is our sole guidance. The vote must come from the unconfirmed.
1,talk,7,1,3,Everyone please consider voting Kenji. His early claim as seer might be a tactic to gain trust. It's risky to rely on a sole divination.
1,talk,8,1,1,I will vote Victoria.
1,talk,9,1,5,Quick votes based only on Kenji’s CO could be risky Let’s hear opinions from  @Minako  and @Ryuji before deciding
1,talk,10,2,2,Kenji's claim is uncertain but we must consider all angles before voting.
1,talk,11,2,4,Victoria is human. The vote should be for one of the unconfirmed. My judgment falls on Mizuki.
1,talk,12,2,3,I urge us to reflect on our choice; voting Kenji could prevent the werewolf from gaining further control. Voting hastily may cost us dearly.
1,talk,13,2,1,Over
1,talk,14,2,5, @Ryuji  calling me a suspect so fast seems odd. Can you clarify why you picked me out?
1,talk,15,3,2,Let's not rush. Ryuji can you share your reasoning for suspecting Mizuki?
1,talk,16,3,4, @Mizuki  You first doubted the Seer's words then deflected suspicion. That logic is discordant.
1,talk,17,3,3, If Kenji is really seer why not wait for more information to reveal? His immediate claim raises doubts. Let's consider the possibility of deceit.
1,talk,18,3,5,I’ll vote Victoria today. Her push against Kenji feels too abrupt and disruptive. Let’s not lose focus under pressure.

2,talk,0,0,2,We need to reassess our situation. Any thoughts on what could have happened last night?
2,talk,1,0,5,Ryuji’s been single-minded about me since yesterday.  @Minako  shouldn’t we question why he’s so insistent?
2,talk,2,0,4, @Minako  The seer's fall confirms my fears. Mizuki's logic was a diversion to hide her guilt.
2,talk,3,1,2,Let's remain objective. Mizuki can you explain your reasoning further?
2,talk,4,1,5,Ryuji’s constant push to vote me out is suspicious. Wolves often fixate on easy targets.  @Minako  should reconsider.
2,talk,5,1,4, @Minako  Mizuki's dissent silenced the seer. The contract of truth has been broken. Judgment is due.
2,talk,6,2,2,We need to analyze calmly. Ryuji what evidence supports your claim against Mizuki?
2,talk,7,2,5, @Minako  Ryuji’s certainty feels forced. Wolves love rushing decisions. Please consider who benefits most from that.
2,talk,8,2,4,My contract is with victory. I am the wolf. Let us cast our final judgment upon Mizuki.
2,talk,9,3,2,Ryuji's admission is surprising. Let's focus on what benefits us most next.
2,talk,10,3,5, @Minako  I’m voting Ryuji but your calm this whole game worries me. If we’re wrong the wolf wins. Please think carefully.
2,talk,11,3,4, @Minako  Consider Mizuki's dissent which cost us the seer. Justice must be served.
