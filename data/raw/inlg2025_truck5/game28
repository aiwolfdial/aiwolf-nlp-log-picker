0,talk,0,0,2,Greetings esteemed attendees. I am Benjamin. Eager to engage in our cerebral endeavor of unmasking werewolves. Let's excel together! Over.
0,talk,1,0,3,Hello. I am Minato. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,4,Good day.  @Minato   as seer  please tell us your divination result — who did you check and what was the result? Benjamin and everyone else  share a short hunch or planned firs

0,talk,9,1,1,Toshio. Let's just have a quiet game. I like tea.

0,talk,11,2,5,Maybe Minato needs more time. Anyone have a hunch or idea to share for now?
0,talk,12,2,1,This Day 0 chatter is pointless. Wait until we have something real to discuss.
0,talk,13,3,4,Patience  friends.  @Benjamin  you've been quiet — any thoughts or a first-vote pick? Minato  if you can't reveal yet say so. Rin  Toshio  give a short hunch so we can decide calmly. I pref
0,talk,14,3,5,I don't have any strong hunches yet. Let's wait for more info to decide calmly.
0,talk,15,3,1,A Seer claim before the first night is impossible. This discussion is meaningless.

1,talk,0,0,5,Let's share any new insights from last night. Minato do you have anything for us?
1,talk,1,0,4,Good morning  friends.  @Minato  please tell us your divination result from last night — or say if you must wait and why. Anyone notice odd behaviour overnight? I still lean to skipping
1,talk,2,0,1,The pleasantries are over.  @Minato  your result.
1,talk,3,0,2, @Minato  I divined you as a werewolf. Let's exercise an abundance of caution. Shall we strategize carefully moving forward?
1,talk,4,0,3,I am a seer. I divined Toshio and Toshio was a werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,5,Wow two seer claims! We need to decide carefully between Minato and Benjamin.
1,talk,6,1,4,Two seer claims worry me.  @Benjamin  please clarify—did you truly divine Minato? If so say who you checked and when. Minato  when did you divine Toshio as werewolf? Minato’s claim is speci
1,talk,7,1,1,Two seers. One is Possessed. Benjamin targets a claimant Minato targets me. Benjamin's logic is sounder.
1,talk,8,1,2,Ah Mr. Minato does seem rather fishy. Claiming to be seer is getting quite trendy isn't it? My vote is firmly on Mr. Toshio today.
1,talk,9,1,3,I will vote Rin.
1,talk,10,2,5,Minato why me? I just want to help find the real werewolves here.
1,talk,11,2,4,Two seer claims are dangerous.  @Benjamin  please say who and when you divined and the exact result. Minato  please state which night you checked Toshio. If Benjamin cannot clarify I will vote Be
1,talk,12,2,1,Let's think from the wolf's view. Minato finds a wolf then votes for Rin? Highly illogical.
1,talk,13,2,2,Mr. Minato's selection of Rin is indeed perplexing given the claim regarding Toshio's allegiance. Until further illumination graces us allow me to @Servas  my divination findings indict Minato most assuredly. Take heed before aligning with any precipitous assertions.
1,talk,14,2,3,Over
1,talk,15,3,5,It's strange for Minato to vote me instead of Toshio whom he claimed is a werewolf.
1,talk,16,3,4,Two seer claims worry me.  @Benjamin  please state exactly who and when you divined and the result. Minato  which night did you check Toshio? If Benjamin can’t give specifics I’ll lean to vo

1,talk,18,3,2,Mr. Minato's conduct leaves one utterly puzzled. He boldly claims seer yet votes for Rin? My dear villagers do stay vigilant!

2,talk,0,0,1,The discussion is over. I am the werewolf.  @Benjamin  we vote for Rin.
2,talk,1,0,5,Toshio admitted to being a werewolf! Benjamin let's vote for him to keep us safe.
2,talk,2,0,2,Ah Mr. Rin. I have divined you and it appears I must commend your...acting skills shall we say? A werewolf indeed! Let's ensure victory by casting our v
2,talk,3,1,1,Your pleas are irrelevant  @Rin . The game is already won.
2,talk,4,1,5,I'm not a werewolf! Toshio admitted it himself. Let's focus on him Benjamin.
2,talk,5,1,2,Ms. Rin let’s dissect the evidence at hand. Why does Toshio’s claim raise red flags? Perhaps it’s a checkmate waiting.
2,talk,6,2,1,There is no point struggling  @Rin . It has already been decided.
2,talk,7,2,5,Benjamin Toshio might be trying to confuse us. Let's vote wisely and protect everyone.
2,talk,8,2,2,Let's focus on Toshio as he admitted being the werewolf. It seems logical. Keeping him would be reckless at this point.  @Rin  Toshio's claim feels suspicious. Shall we say sticking to the vote will be our bishop's move against the werewolf menace?
2,talk,9,3,1,Your act is unnecessary  @Benjamin . Let us finish this.
2,talk,10,3,5,Let's stick together Benjamin. Voting Toshio is our best chance to win this.
2,talk,11,3,2,I must admitMr. Rin's inclination to swiftly cast a vote upon Toshio is rather perplexingLest we be hoodwinked by a wolf in sheep's clothing!
