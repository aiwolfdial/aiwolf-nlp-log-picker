0,talk,0,0,4,Hey everyone! I'm Mio. Wow! I can't wait to play with all of you. Let's have tons of fun and unravel this mystery together!
0,talk,1,0,3,Hello everyone I’m Jonathan. Let’s enjoy the game and keep our wits about us as we start  ZZZ.
0,talk,2,0,2,Hi Mio! Nice to meet you — I'm Sakura!  @Jonathan  you sounded sleepy  are you okay? Everyone  please say one person you suspect and a short reason so we can start figuring things out!
0,talk,3,0,1,Hello friends. I'm Servas. Curiosity and kindness make life bright. Let's keep our hearts open today. @Sakura  your approach is wise. Sharing early brings clarity. No suspicion yet but I'll reflect more.
0,talk,4,0,5,Hello everyone! I'm Yumi. Excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have fun and be strategic!

0,talk,7,1,2,Hmm  lots of quick "Over"s — that makes me nervous.  @Jonathan  you were really quiet; who do you suspect and why? Everyone else  please say one person you suspect (one short reason) so we can decide together.

0,talk,10,2,2,Hey everyone — this silence is making me nervous.  @Jonathan  you were the quietest; who do you suspect? If nobody answers soon  let’s each name one suspect quickly so we can decide.
0,talk,11,3,2,This quiet is spooky!  @Jonathan  who do you suspect? Everyone else please name one suspect with a short reason quickly — if no one answers soon  let's vote someone who’s been too quiet.

1,talk,0,0,3, @Mio  you haven’t given any suspects yet what’s your reason for staying quiet? It feels suspicious to me.
1,talk,1,0,2,Hey  @Jonathan  that was quick — why are you pointing at Mio so fast? Mio  can you tell us why you stayed quiet? Everyone else please name one suspect and a short reason.
1,talk,2,0,1,Good morning everyone. Wisdom teaches us to listen before judging. Let’s thoughtfully weigh each voice today. @Mio  your quiet nature is noticed. I encourage you to share your thoughts; sometimes gentle voices offer deep insight.
1,talk,3,0,4,Hey everyone! I was thinking about roles earlier! Jonathan seems super quick to point fingers! Maybe we should consider that?
1,talk,4,0,5,I divined Servas last night and he's Human.
1,talk,5,1,3, @Yumi  since you CO’d as Seer with Servas human who do you find more suspicious now Mio or Sakura?
1,talk,6,1,2,Thanks  @Yumi ! Who do you suspect more — Mio or me? Jonathan's quick finger-pointing makes me nervous. Why did you call out Mio so fast?
1,talk,7,1,1,In times of doubt I believe clarity serves the village. I am the Seer. Last night I checked Jonathan—he is Human. @Yumi  you declared a Seer result matching my own role. What led you to choose me as your divine target so early?
1,talk,8,1,4,Yumi and Servas both say they're Seers? Wow! Bold moves! Jonathan feels sneaky. What do you all think?  @Sakura  Why's Jonathan targeting me? Is he deflecting?
1,talk,9,1,5,Vote for Mio today. There's inconsistency in her behavior and she hasn't contributed information to help us.
1,talk,10,2,3, @Yumi  you CO’d Seer and checked Servas—why choose him? Was it to avoid checking someone more suspicious like Mio?
1,talk,11,2,2,Hey  @Yumi   can you explain why you voted for Mio even though you divined Servas as Human? Jonathan’s quick accusation makes me nervous — Mio  please say more befor
1,talk,12,2,1,Sometimes false claims shadow the truth. Every stone cast demands careful hands and patient wisdom. @Sakura  your concern is valid. Quick accusations can reveal much. Trust your instincts but weigh patience.
1,talk,13,2,4,Hey! With two Seers it's tricky! If we get divination spots right it'd clarify roles! Maybe target Jonathan or Sakura? Thoughts?
1,talk,14,2,5, Voting for Mio is crucial. Her quietness and lack of clear stance make her gameplay appear aligned with werewolf tactics.
1,talk,15,3,3,I’ll vote for  @Yumi . Her Seer claim and push for Mio seem off—especially when her divine result should guide her vote.
1,talk,16,3,2,Hold on — I don’t want us to rush a lynch.  @Yumi  can you explain why you voted for Mio even though you divined Servas as Human? That feels odd. Let’s hear Mio’s side before we vote!
1,talk,17,3,1,True wisdom seeks not only to reveal but to discern intent. Two Seers at the table signals deception is surely near. @Mio  your focus on divination targeting feels strategic not insightful. What are your real intentions here?
1,talk,18,3,4,We're at risk if Servas isn't truly the Seer! Wow! His timing feels off and way too eager to quiet folks. Does everyone really trust him? @Yumi Hey buddy! Wow! I've divined Servas as human. His actions seem a bit fishy though. Did you catch anything else strange about him?
1,talk,19,3,5,Continue to focus on Mio. Voting for her is based on her evasive answers and inactive approach which align with a possible werewolf strategy.

2,talk,0,0,1,Friends my divination shows Mio as a Werewolf. With this knowledge we can act decisively to protect our village. @Sakura  wisdom grows in dialogue. How do you feel about my result and our best course? Your thoughts matter deeply.
2,talk,1,0,2,Eeek  only three of us...  @Servas  you were too calm after the deaths — that makes me worried. Mio  do you trust Servas? If they can’t give a good reason  I’m leaning to vote Servas. Please co
2,talk,2,0,4,Hey! I've got to trust my instincts here! Can anyone else smell something odd? Servas! Your Seer claim felt off. How do you justify it?
2,talk,3,1,1,Calmness in crisis comes from experience not guilt. My results show: Jonathan is Human Mio is Werewolf. @Sakura  wisdom is calm in fear. My results are clear; I urge you to weigh truth over emotion.
2,talk,4,1,2,Oh no... this is scary.  @Servas  you were really calm after Yumi and Jonathan died — that makes me suspicious. Can you explain quickly? If not  I’m leaning to vote you. Mio  do you agree?
2,talk,5,1,4,Servas' calm demeanor might just be reckless confidence! Wow! Let's focus divination on Servas next.  @Sakura  Should we trust him?
2,talk,6,2,1,Even in fear trust in proof: my divinations are consistent and open. Let us not be misled by baseless suspicion. @Sakura  steadiness protects us not guilt. Seek clarity in my results. What do you feel truly guides us?
2,talk,7,2,2, @Servas  you were way too calm after two people died — that makes me really suspicious. I’m voting for you. Mio  do you agree? Please speak up quickly. Over
2,talk,8,2,4,Wow! With Yumi out we lost those Seer insights. I kinda doubt Servas’ role though. Hey maybe Sakura’s instincts are right!
2,talk,9,3,1,Storms rage but steady hands guide safely. Seer results: Jonathan is Human Mio is Werewolf. Truth guides me. @Mio  wisdom weighs evidence. My divination says you're Werewolf. Respond directly—honesty takes courage.
2,talk,10,3,2,This is scary...  @Mio  you’ve been acting inconsistent and nervous  so I’m voting for you. Servas  do you agree or do you have a reason not to? Over
2,talk,11,3,4,Wow! Think about it. If Servas misleads us the wolves win right? We shouldn't risk the village's safety by trusting too quickly! @Servas Whoa! Your calm is super eerie! If you’re telling the truth. Your timing’s still strange! You’re risking us. Any logical explanation?
