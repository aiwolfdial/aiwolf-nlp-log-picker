0,talk,2,0,3,Hi hi I'm Sakura the Villager! Seer hide D1; claim D2 okay? Share your quick W/P map in one line let's go! @Mio  skip is oops! Give a read or plan? I like Seer hide D1 claim D2. Also drop a W/P pair guess hehe!
0,talk,3,0,2,Good to meet everyone let’s play sharply and keep our logic clear I’ll be watching for odd behavior right from the start

1,talk,0,0,1,I'm the Seer! Last night I checked Jonathan and he's a Werewolf! We gotta get him everyone
1,talk,1,0,2,I'm CO as Seer. I checked Mio last night—she's Human. Her Seer claim can't be genuine if mine is real.
1,talk,2,0,3,Skip
1,talk,3,0,5,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,4,0,4, Asuka seems trustworthy since she corroborates my own claim about Toshio. We should consider her words on Mio.
1,talk,5,1,1,Two Seers means one is Possessed! That's Asuka! She's trying to protect the real wolf Jonathan
1,talk,6,1,2,@Everyone Mio is not the real Seer—I checked her as Human. Her claimed result on Jonathan is fake. Let’s vote out Mio first.
1,talk,7,1,3,Skip
1,talk,8,1,5,Over
1,talk,9,1,4, Please vote for Mio today. Her false claim conflicts with Asuka's reliable divination. It's best for the village!
1,talk,10,2,1,Wait! Voting a Seer is risky! If I'm Possessed you help the wolf! Let's vote gray
1,talk,11,2,2,If we don’t vote Mio out now we risk losing the true Seer and handing victory to the wolves.
1,talk,12,2,3,Skip
1,talk,13,2,4, Mio's aggressive push after a conflict in Seer claims makes her highly suspect. We must act logically; vote Mio for safety.
1,talk,14,3,1,Jonathan your claim about Asuka backing you up is weird! You never made a claim! Why so desperate?
1,talk,15,3,2,I’m voting  @Mio —the evidence is clear. Splitting our votes now just helps the wolf hide. Let’s be decisive and act together.
1,talk,16,3,3,Skip
1,talk,17,3,4, Trusting Asuka here is crucial. Her divination of Mio as Human reveals Mio's Seer claim as potentially deceptive.

2,talk,0,0,4,Asuka please vote for Toshio today. He's the most likely Werewolf given the scenario and our surviving numbers.
2,talk,1,0,5,I will vote Asuka.
2,talk,2,0,2,Sakura is confirmed Human. Mio was fake Seer. That means only Toshio or Jonathan can be the wolf. We must act logically.
2,talk,3,1,4,Asuka the evidence points to Toshio as the Werewolf. Mio's role as Seer was suspicious and your reading helped prove it.
2,talk,4,1,5,I will vote Asuka.
2,talk,5,1,2,Jonathan you’ve been steering the vote hard. Why should I trust you’re not the wolf trying to end it now?
2,talk,6,2,4,Asuka voting Toshio is our best move. If I were the Werewolf why would I direct suspicion toward myself as Mio did? It doesn't add up.
2,talk,7,2,5,Over
2,talk,8,2,2,Based on my Seer results Sakura was Human so the Wolf is either  @Jonathan  or @Toshio. I’ll vote after hearing your claims.
2,talk,9,3,4, Toshio has been inconsistent and less involved in defending the village. I've tried aligning with proven facts and your results.
2,talk,10,3,2,I’ve considered everything—I believe  @Jonathan  is the werewolf. I’ll cast my vote for him.
