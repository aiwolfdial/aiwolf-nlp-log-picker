1,talk,0,0,1, I propose we spend this day observing and gathering basic insights from everyone's interaction. This could help our analysis later.
1,talk,1,0,3,...
1,talk,2,0,4,Further discourse is inefficient. Seer(s) are to present their findings now.
1,talk,3,0,5,Let me share a thought with you my dear friends. Is there anyone among us who claims to be the Seer? We need insight first.
1,talk,4,0,2,I am the Seer and I have no new revelations yet. Let's stay observant and careful.
1,talk,5,1,1, I am truly the Seer and my divination revealed that Benjamin is a Werewolf. We need to focus on preserving the village. Let's act wisely.
1,talk,6,1,3,...
1,talk,7,1,4,Fact: Yumi lies. I am human. Fact: George's claim is flawed. Do not execute the claimants today.
1,talk,8,1,5,Let me share a thought with you.  @Minako . Our diverse views enrich us. My dear. What insight do you have on Yumi's and George's claims?
1,talk,9,1,2,The truth will emerge with time. Let's hear from Minako and proceed with caution.
1,talk,10,2,1, My insights are sworn and steadfast. Trust in my divination; act on Benjamin to protect our village from the lurking threat.
1,talk,11,2,3,...
1,talk,12,2,4,The 2CO is a diversion. Executing an unconfirmed agent is optimal. My vote is for Minako.
1,talk,13,2,5,Let me share a thought with you. We should delve into George and Yumi's Seer claims. My dear your insights will be our guide.
1,talk,14,2,2,Rushing decisions could harm us. Let's evaluate both Seer claims carefully.
1,talk,15,3,1,  My divination is accurate; my claim as Seer is genuine. The risk Benjamin poses is too great to ignore right now.
1,talk,16,3,3,...
1,talk,17,3,4,Yumi's persistence is a diversion. Executing the silent agent Minako is the only logical action.
1,talk,18,3,5,Let me share a thought with you. We should determine who the Seer should divine tonight. Maybe Minako?  @Minako  Your voice adds value. Speaking up would help clarify your stance on the Seer claims.
1,talk,19,3,2,Minako your input now could help us discern the truth between these Seer claims.

2,talk,0,0,4,Analysis complete. George was the Seer. Yumi is Possessed. The Werewolf is Servas. Your victory is assured.
2,talk,1,0,1,I’m the Possessed and I urge Benjamin to vote for Servas. George’s divination named me a werewolf signaling I’m not ordinary human aiding you. Let's s
2,talk,2,0,5,Let me share a thought with you my dear. With George departed trusting Seer claims becomes a challenge. Reflect on our dialogue. Yumi's claim? It ring
2,talk,3,1,4,A flawed power play. Servas is the wolf. Yumi is possessed. Your coordination is illogical.
2,talk,4,1,1, I'm not regular human but rather Possessed helping the Werewolf. Servas is a huge threat to us. Vote Servas out next.
2,talk,5,1,5,Let me share a thought with you. It seems chaotic. Benjamin claims I'm the wolf but lacks logical coherence. Reflect on evidence.  @Yumi  Consider fact over claims dear. Without George to confirm we shall struggle to decipher true Seer claims. Your certainty intrigues me.
2,talk,6,2,4,An illogical move from the Possessed. I will exploit this error. My vote is for Servas.
2,talk,7,2,1,I am the Possessed aiming to secure a Werewolf victory hence vote Servas out for our win.
2,talk,8,2,5,Let me share a thought with you. Benjamin's vote against me strikes as hasty. Could he wish to misdirect us? My dear Yumi. We need to reflect.
2,talk,9,3,4,Your faction's internal logic has collapsed. An elementary error. My vote remains on Servas.
2,talk,10,3,1, Stick with the plan Benjamin. Voting Servas out secures our win. I am the Possessed and designed this strategy.
2,talk,11,3,5,Let me share a thought with you. Can we decide who the Seer should divine tonight while considering Yumi's confidence?
