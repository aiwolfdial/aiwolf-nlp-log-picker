0,talk,0,0,4,Hi everyone! So who do you think might be suspicious? Let's figure this out together!
0,talk,1,0,5,Hi Sakura. Let's get claims — seer/doctor/medium first. If no one's claiming   @Shion  please share any reads or a claim. Otherwise everyone name one person you distrust briefly.
0,talk,2,0,1,Morning folks ready to catch some wolves or just here to play nice? I’m not buying every smile I see.
0,talk,3,0,2,Hey buddies! It's Yumi! I'm beyond happy to team up with you! Let's catch some wolves together. Eyes wide open okay? You can do it!

0,talk,5,1,4,I don't have any strong suspicions yet but keeping an eye on May's questions.
0,talk,6,1,5,Nice "play nice" energy  May — could be genuine or a dodge.  @May  what's your read and who do you distrust? If you can't give something concrete  I'll keep you on my list for now. Others: one name you distrust  briefly. O

0,talk,12,2,3,Baseless speculation is a waste of processing time. Substantive data will emerge on Day 1.
0,talk,13,3,4,Let's stay positive everyone! Maybe clues will pop up soon. Patience is key!
0,talk,14,3,5,Noted  Shion. We're running out of patience—let's force info.  @May  you were evasive earlier; give a read or name one person you distrust now. Everyone else: quickly name one person you distrust. If no claims by the end o
0,talk,15,3,3,Your methodology is flawed. Generating noise from a null data set is counterproductive. Await Day 1.

1,talk,0,0,4,So did anyone notice anything strange last night? Let's hear your thoughts!
1,talk,1,0,5,Serious now: any seer/doctor/medium claims?  @May  you've been vague twice — give a concrete read or name one person you distrust  or I’ll vote you. Everyone else: one suspect briefly. Over
1,talk,2,0,2,Hey buddy! Benjamin's quite the whirlwind. Feeling like he's asking too much? You can do it! What are your thoughts on his push?
1,talk,3,0,1, I’m the Seer. Last night I divined Yumi—she’s Human  not Werewolf. Let’s focus on Shion or Sakura for today’s vote.
1,talk,4,0,3,One claim is insufficient data. Per protocol the Possessed must also claim Seer. Who is it?
1,talk,5,1,4,May's claim is interesting. Should we focus on confirming her or checking Shion?
1,talk,6,1,5,May — if you're seer  give exact phrasing/time of your divination and why you push Shion/Sakura.  @Shion  your comment about "possessed must also claim seer" reads like pushing a fake double-claim. Explain now or you'll get my vote. Over
1,talk,7,1,2,May's seer claim sounds really serious! If May is honest. I'm safe for sure! Let's not risk anyone sweetie. I'm siding with Shion!
1,talk,8,1,1,Wolf is Shion Sakura or Benjamin since Yumi is confirmed human. I’m voting Shion today unless someone counter-claims.
1,talk,9,1,3,May's claim is unverified. Lacking a counter-claim our only logical target is the unconfirmed pool.
1,talk,10,2,4,If we're trusting May let's focus on Shion or Benjamin. What's everyone thinking?
1,talk,11,2,5, @May  if you're the seer  give the exact wording and night of your divination (e.g. “Night 1 I divined Yumi: Human”). Also why are you pushing Shion/Sakura sp
1,talk,12,2,2,Hey team! How about we trust May slowly while keeping eyes on Shion or Benny? Thoughts on Ben’s style?  @Benjamin  Wow. Your questions are tricky! Are you trying to stir the pot or spot wolves? I'm super curious!
1,talk,13,2,1, @Yumi  you're confirmed human so step up—who do you trust least among Shion Sakura and Benjamin? Your vote matters.
1,talk,14,2,3, @Benjamin  Your accusation is based on a logical fallacy. This makes you my prime candidate.
1,talk,15,3,4,Benjamin's questions feel intense. Maybe we should look closer at him today. Thoughts?
1,talk,16,3,5,If May's claim is true (she divined Yumi = Human Night 1)  wolves are probably Shion or Sakura.  @Shion  your silence and that "possessed must also claim" line looks like stirring the pot — explain now or you'll draw votes. Sakura  any concrete read? If we g
1,talk,17,3,2,Oh boy sweeties. Shion's quietness has me puzzled while Benjamin's high energy is so catchy! Mysteries indeed! My vote's with Shion!
1,talk,18,3,1, Yumi is human. I vote  @Shion —their evasion is wolfy. Follow me or we risk it all.
1,talk,19,3,3, @Benjamin  your reasoning is based on a fallacy making you the primary suspect. My vote is for you.

2,talk,0,0,1,I checked Shion last night—my result is Human. Sakura and Benjamin you’re in my sights for the last wolf.
2,talk,1,0,2,I totally believe in May's seer claim! Nobody's challenged it. Let's dig into figuring out Benjamin and Sakura's roles sweeties!
2,talk,2,0,4,I think Benjamin's energy is suspicious. Should we focus on him today? Thoughts?
2,talk,3,0,5, @May  restate your Night 1 divination exactly (e.g. “Night 1 I divined Yumi: Human”). If you can’t or won’t  I’ll vote you. Sakura  Yumi — any concrete reads? I
2,talk,4,1,1,Since Shion was human the wolf must be Benjamin or Sakura.  @Yumi  let's lock in together. Who looks more suspicious to you?
2,talk,5,1,2,Let's dive in sweeties! Benjamin sure has some questionable vibes tonight.  @Sakura  What do you think about his energy? Natural or forced?
2,talk,6,1,4,Benjamin's energy feels a bit forced to me. Maybe we should focus on him today?
2,talk,7,1,5, @May  restate your Night 1 divination exactly now (e.g. "Night 1 I divined Yumi: Human"). If you can't or won't  I'll vote you. Others  give a quick read. Over
2,talk,8,2,1,Benjamin’s pushing way too hard for mistakes—I’m Seer and my results are clear. I’m voting Benjamin unless Sakura objects.
2,talk,9,2,2,Hey sweeties! I've been thinking. Sakura's been super quiet lately. Maybe she's our divination target? It could clear up mysteries!
2,talk,10,2,4,I agree Yumi. Maybe I should be divined to clear things up. What do you all think?
2,talk,11,2,5, @May  please restate your Night 1 divination exactly (e.g. “Night 1 I divined Yumi: Human”). If you won't  I'll vote you. Sakura and Yumi — quick reads? Over
2,talk,12,3,1,Benjamin’s suspicious questioning screams wolf. I’m voting Benjamin— @Yumi  @Sakura let’s end this together.
2,talk,13,3,2,Benjamin. I can't get past your persistent pressure on May. It's hinting wolf to me! Sakura. Let's be cautious together.  @Benjamin . Your intense focus on May feels quite suspicious! Why so insistent? It seems like you're trying to catch her off-guard sweetie!
2,talk,14,3,4,I'm with you May and Yumi. Benjamin's pressure feels off. Let's focus on him!
2,talk,15,3,5, @May  restate your Night 1 divination exactly now (e.g. “Night 1 I divined Yumi: Human”). If you can’t or won’t  you look fake and I’ll vote you. Sakura  Yumi — q

3,talk,0,0,2,Hey sweeties! We need to be super strategic. May's been so consistent. So what do you think? Should we try more divinations again?
3,talk,1,0,1,@Sakura I divined you last night—you’re the werewolf.  @Yumi  now’s our chance to end this game let’s vote Sakura!
3,talk,2,0,4,May I trusted you! Are you sure about this? Let's think carefully before deciding!
3,talk,3,1,2,Hey sweetie! Benjamin's focus on May and Sakura might not just be pressure! Let's dig deep while we trust May's insight.  @Sakura  I get the shock hun. May's certainty about you was a twist! Is there a reason for her claim?
3,talk,4,1,1, @Yumi  Sakura is my wolf result from last night. Vote Sakura with me and the villagers win this game right now.
3,talk,5,1,4,Yumi please consider if May might be mistaken. Let's be sure before we vote!
3,talk,6,2,2,I trust May's judgment! Sakura. let's stay logical. May nailed my role before Benjamin's voting sealed suspicion! Thoughts?  @Sakura . May's deduced roles were consistent. Since Benjamin's luck ran out. maybe it's time to vote and trust May? Thoughts sweetie?
3,talk,7,2,1, @Yumi  I’ve checked every player but Sakura. My final result shows Sakura is the werewolf. Trust my chain and vote Sakura.
3,talk,8,2,4,Yumi I understand. But are we absolutely sure? Let's not rush our decision!
3,talk,9,3,2,Alright sweethearts! Since May's always sharing results and Sakura is last left out. We should go with May's logic right?
3,talk,10,3,1,I’ve checked every player. Sakura came up wolf—no ambiguity left. My vote’s for Sakura.
3,talk,11,3,4,I guess this is it then. May I hope your reading is right. Good luck everyone!
