0,talk,1,0,3,Good morning my name is George. I am simply a villager with no special abilities to offer this group.
0,talk,2,0,5,I hope nobody slips into gut instincts this game. Let’s keep all logic tight or risk giving wolves an easy play.
0,talk,3,0,1,Morning. Quick role claim from George smells off — wolves often fake villager to blend in.  @George  why reveal so soon  and who do you suspect? Everyone else  give one quick read. Over
0,talk,4,0,4,Hello. I am Misaki. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,2,I am Servas. I look forward to our deliberations.

0,talk,8,1,1,George's quick villager claim and then silence feels off. I'm inclined to nominate  @George  unless someone has a strong counter-read — who do you suspect? Over
0,talk,9,1,4,Over
0,talk,10,2,2,Over
0,talk,11,2,1,I nominate  @George  for lynch. Quick villager claim + silence is suspicious. Any strong counter-reads? If not  let's vote him. Over
0,talk,12,3,1,I'll cast my vote for  @George . Speak now if you disagree — otherwise let's close this. Over

1,talk,0,0,2,The dawn breaks. Let the one who gazes into the hearts of others now share their findings.
1,talk,1,0,4,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,2,0,3,There is merit in clarity. I openly declared as villager to prevent confusion later in discussions. @Shion  your suspicion is noted though early claims are not in themselves incriminating.
1,talk,3,0,5, @Shion  you’re eager to push out George but quick votes often serve the wolves. Why risk a wrong move now?
1,talk,4,0,1,I'm the seer. I divined  @George  on day 0 — HUMAN. We just lynched an innocent. That makes Shunichi more suspicious to me for pressing against the move and pointing at me. Misaki  Servas
1,talk,5,1,2,One Seer claims the covenant yet speaks of a ghost. A contract built on paradox holds no truth.
1,talk,6,1,4,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,7,1,3,Let's judge based on evidence not just on initial impressions. Shion's seer claim merits scrutiny and considered logic. @Shion You named me human Shion. Still your earlier push toward my lynch seems rushed. Consistency matters here.
1,talk,8,1,5, @Shion  if you revealed George is human why did you try to vote him so fast? That’s not logical at all.
1,talk,9,1,1,I'm the seer — I divined George on day 0 and he's HUMAN.Why I pushed: his immediate villager claim plus silence matched a wolf pattern; I wanted to force @Shunichi  for how he reacted and for pushing back at my logic instead of giving reads. @Shunichi  explain your stance. Misaki  Servas  George — share votes/reads.
1,talk,10,2,2,A contract must be built upon truth.  @Shion  your testimony spoke of a ghost where none exists. Explain this.
1,talk,11,2,4,Over
1,talk,12,2,3,I believe logic is our best tool. Consistency in claims and voting will reveal the truth. Let's focus on solid reasoning. @Misaki  you have stated your vote twice for Shunichi. Could you provide your reasoning for suspecting Shunichi so clearly?
1,talk,13,2,5, @Misaki  you vote for me without reasoning—classic wolf move relying on easy targets. Care to explain your logic?
1,talk,14,2,1,I'm the seer — I divined George (D0): HUMAN. We just lost an innocent. @Shunichi  your reaction looks suspicious; explain your reads and vote now. Misaki  Servas  George — state your votes. Over
1,talk,15,3,2,A flawed contract benefits only the shadows.  @Shion  your memory is of events that did not transpire.
1,talk,16,3,3,Let's use only verifiable facts. Haste is our enemy. Everyone please state your stance and reasoning clearly. @Shion Your seer claim and actions don't match—divining me as human but leading my lynch. That creates logical doubt.
1,talk,17,3,5, Misaki.
1,talk,18,3,1,Reminder: I'm the seer — I divined George (D0): HUMAN. We just lost an innocent. @Shunichi   your pushback felt defensive and vague. Misaki  Servas  George — state your votes/reads now. If no good defense  I'll nominate @Shunichi. Over

2,talk,0,0,3,We now lack a seer so everyone must base their judgments on behavior and past logic.
2,talk,1,0,4,I will vote Shunichi.
2,talk,2,0,5, jump on the easy target.
2,talk,3,1,3,With no seer left our judgment must be careful. Rash motives or unclear logic risk mislead. I ask for clear reasoning. @Misaki  your intention to vote Shunichi lacks supporting logic. Can you clarify your reasons concretely?
2,talk,4,1,4,Over
2,talk,5,1,5, @George  see how Misaki pushes to end the game fast? Wolves always rush votes with no logic. Don't fall for it.
2,talk,6,2,3,Let's review yesterday: Shunichi and Misaki were both suspected for unclear reasoning. Now clarity is vital for trust. @Misaki  your decision to vote Shunichi remains unexplained. What specifically leads you to suspect them?
2,talk,7,2,5, @Misaki  your rush to end things without thought is suspicious. Wolves love easy votes. George don’t fall for it.
2,talk,8,3,3,Reason and caution guide us; hasty votes risk villagers. Let's be deliberate in decisions. @Shunichi  your insistence on careful play is noted. What about Misaki's silence after questions?
2,talk,9,3,5, @George  today’s vote is critical. I’m voting Misaki—wolves always dodge reason and rush. Pick logic over panic or we lose.
