0,talk,0,0,5,Let's keep it simple: each of you say one suspicion and why. I'll go first — I'm watching  @George ; his timing and tone feel off. Don't rush a lynch without reasons. Over
0,talk,1,0,3,Hey everyone. I am Misaki. Let us work together to figure things out. Mr. Jonathan do you have any suspicions yet?
0,talk,2,0,2,Hello. I am Jonathan. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,3,0,4,Well isn't this a cozy crowd! I'll come right out: I'm the seer. Looking forward to seeing who shines in the moonlight. @Shunichi  keeping it simple sounds smart. Does putting George on the spot help the village or give the wolf a smile?

0,talk,5,1,5, @May  If you're really the seer  give one result or tell us your plan — vague claims don't help. I'm suspicious of Jonathan; that quick 'villager' label looks

1,talk,0,0,5,Alright   @Jonathan  — last chance: justify that instant "villager" claim with a concrete reason or plan. If you can't  I'll vote for you. Others  one short suspicion each. O
1,talk,1,0,3,Ms. May. I wonder if you could share more about your divination? A touch more clarity could guide our village toward the right choice.
1,talk,2,0,2,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,3,0,4,A dazzling request Misaki. My divination result: Shunichi is Human. Simple clear—now who feels wolfish to you? @Shunichi  care to explain why you leaped onto Jonathan so hard yesterday? Bold or just bored of blending in?
1,talk,4,0,1,The scales have been rebalanced.  @Jonathan  your intended vote now falls upon a confirmed human.
1,talk,5,1,5, @May  Nice timing — why reveal "Shunichi human" now and what’s your plan with that result? If you really saw that  why not point at someone wolfish instead? Jo
1,talk,6,1,3,Ms. May's divination is quite reassuring. I wonder if we should explore more to uncover any suspicious activity. Perhaps Mr. George?
1,talk,7,1,2,Over
1,talk,8,1,4,All right if Shunichi's cleared by my vision where should our spotlight fall? Jonathan's early villager claim still stings. @Misaki A bold nudge Misaki. If George is your curiosity what do you find off about him so far? Let's tease some secrets out.
1,talk,9,1,1,May's word forms our contract. Shunichi is proven human. Thus only Jonathan and Misaki remain suspect.
1,talk,10,2,5, @May  That "Shunichi is Human" reveal smells staged. If you're the seer  say when you divined me and give at least one other result or your plan. If not  why clea
1,talk,11,2,3,Shunichi's cleared. Jonathan and George drew attention for early claims. We need logical reasons behind past actions. Thoughts?  @Jonathan  Hello. I wonder about your silence after Shunichi's clearance. I feel like asking how your strategy might have changed since then?
1,talk,12,2,4,Suspicion's circling like vultures today. George too quick to accept—strategy or just hungry for guidance? @George  you frame my words as contract—does that make you judge or just eager for an alibi? Mind explaining your logic?
1,talk,13,2,1,Jonathan's vote against a human is an undeniable fact. My judgment falls upon him.
1,talk,14,3,5, @May  If you're really the seer  tell us when you divined and who you'll check next — otherwise your timing looks baked to redirect. Jonathan's fast "village
1,talk,15,3,3,I wonder if George's lack of desire for divination and evidence should concern us. He hasn't made any attempts I notice.
1,talk,16,3,4,Jonathan's wolf-scent lingers—his vote on Shunichi is clumsy or is it desperate? Overdefending himself yet? @Jonathan  feeling shy now that Shunichi's confirmed human? I sense your tune's changed—have you something to hide?
1,talk,17,3,1,We have but one contract for this day's judgment. Jonathan's transgression must be answered.

2,talk,0,0,4,Well that night's feast was brutal—are the wolves watching us panic yet? Ready for a wild reveal?
2,talk,1,0,3,I wonder if it would be wise to further explore Mr. Shunichi's recent demeanor or perhaps ask Ms. May for her thoughtful insights?
2,talk,2,0,5,Morning. I'm the seer — I divined  @May  last night: she's a werewolf. Wolves killed George. Misaki  what's your vote? Vote May. Over
2,talk,3,1,4,Oh dramatic plot twist! Shunichi late to the Seer party but suddenly seeing monsters. Everyone buying this act? @Misaki  if you trust my results why would a wolf kill the guy who believed me? Something's fishy about Shunichi's "reveal."
2,talk,4,1,3,I find Mr. Shunichi's claim intriguing. If this is an act I wonder who he might align with Ms. May. Who do you suspect?
2,talk,5,1,5,I'm the seer. I divined  @May  last night — she's a werewolf. Wolves killed George. Vote May now. Misaki  what's your vote? Over
2,talk,6,2,4,Misaki it's curious Shunichi waited until now to "discover" me. Real wolf trying to flip the script at crunch time? @Shunichi Oh Shunichi a convenient night vision when the stakes can't get higher? You're seer now that I'm a threat?
2,talk,7,2,3,Mr. Shunichi if you are truly the seer this is significant. Ms. May and you cannot both be. I wonder if we can sort this with true results.
2,talk,8,2,5,I'm the seer — I divined  @May  last night: she's a werewolf. Wolves killed George. Misaki  what's your vote? If you trust me  vote May; if not  reveal now. Over
2,talk,9,3,4,I'm starting to feel a pattern—Shunichi only gets bold after there's blood in the water. Don't let nerves cloud judgment! @Misaki  put the pressure on—why would the real wolf kill my only supporter if I were evil? Shunichi is playing desperate.
2,talk,10,3,3,I wonder if Shunichi's claim is truly compelling. I find Ms. May's truths quite hazy. Perhaps without voting for her we'll lose.
2,talk,11,3,5,I divined  @May  last night — she's a werewolf. Wolves killed George to silence us. Misaki — what's your vote? If you trust me  vote May; if not  say now. Over
