0,talk,3,0,1,Hey folks! It’s Shunichi here. Ready to outsmart our elusive werewolf. Let's treat this as a chess match. No pawns for dinner!

1,talk,0,0,3,I have good eyes. I am Seer. Last moon I saw Victoria. She is human.
1,talk,1,0,1, @Minato  Sounds like Takumi's in Seer mode huh? Should we trust the claim and plot a chess-like divination strat? Your thoughts?
1,talk,2,0,5,If no one else claims Seer should we trust Takumi and focus on Minato and Shunichi for today’s vote?
1,talk,3,0,4,I will vote Minato.
1,talk,4,0,2,Takumi checked Victoria who claimed village. That lines up right? Maybe we can trust him? @Shunichi  is trusting Takumi's claim safe for round one? How do you feel about early Seer claims usually?
1,talk,5,1,3,I am Seer. No one else talk. Why? Liars are hiding.
1,talk,6,1,1,Victoria's backing Minato huh? But trusting Taku feels like a game of blind chess. Let's watch the players and see their moves.
1,talk,7,1,5, @Victoria  you voted Minato pretty quickly—was there a reason or are you just guessing for now?
1,talk,8,1,4,I will vote Minato.
1,talk,9,1,2,Takumi claimed Seer so boldly. I wonder—would a wolf fake that claim first? It's a bit scary to judge right away. @Victoria  you said you'll vote me—was there something about my talk or are you just picking randomly to start?
1,talk,10,2,3,Victoria is human. I saw. One bad wolf hides in Kenji Minato Shunichi. We hunt from them today.
1,talk,11,2,1,Let's take it slow. Blindly trusting Takumi feels like asking for trouble. We should double-check like a chess game. Patience Kenji!
1,talk,12,2,5, @Victoria  can you explain why you're voting Minato without any reason? It feels too forced to me.
1,talk,13,2,4,I will vote Minato.
1,talk,14,2,2,Victoria keeps picking me—maybe she has a reason or it's just my way of speaking? I wonder what others think. @Kenji  you seem concerned by Victoria's votes for me. Do you suspect her or just unsure who to pick?
1,talk,15,3,3,Victoria is friend but strange. Her hunt on Minato is wrong. Shunichi smells bad. His words are a trick.
1,talk,16,3,1,Takumi claims Seer with such confidence. Sounds like a chess move; bold but maybe a bluff. What if he leads the village astray?
1,talk,17,3,5,I’m voting Shunichi. Takumi’s Seer claim makes sense and Shunichi never commits—feels like wolf hiding.
1,talk,18,3,4,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,19,3,2,It feels confusing now... Takumi sounds certain but can we always trust quick role reveals? Should we go slow? @Shunichi  your chess approach seems careful. If you had to choose is Takumi's claim enough to follow right now?
