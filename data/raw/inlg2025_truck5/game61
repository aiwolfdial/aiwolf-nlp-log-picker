0,talk,0,0,2,Hi everyone I’m kind of nervous but I hope we can all play a good game together. Let’s do our best.
0,talk,1,0,3,Hello. I am Benjamin. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,1,Hi everyone looking forward to a fun and fair game. Let's stay observant and work together.
0,talk,3,0,4,I'm Mizuki—calm and logical by nature. I'm a plain villager no special ability. Let's cooperate and reason carefully. @Victoria  you emphasize teamwork; I agree. Logical discussion and clear communication will help us find the werewolf.
0,talk,4,0,5,Hello everyone I'm George excited to play and find out who our werewolf is! Let's have some fun!

1,talk,0,0,1,Good morning everyone. Any thoughts on what we observed and should discuss today?
1,talk,1,0,3,I will vote Mizuki.
1,talk,2,0,2,@all I am the Seer. I divined Benjamin as Human last night. Please keep this in mind as we decide today.
1,talk,3,0,4,I am still the plain villager as I stated on day 0. Has anyone noticed contradictions or odd behavior worth examining? @Benjamin  you voted for me quite early. Can you share your reasoning for suspecting me at this stage?
1,talk,4,0,5, I have important information. I'm the Seer and I divined Victoria last night. She is the Werewolf. Let's discuss.
1,talk,5,1,1,George's claim is suspicious; two Seers? We need to validate these roles carefully.
1,talk,6,1,3,Over
1,talk,7,1,2,@all I divined Benjamin as human so I trust him. George’s aggressive claim is risky. I think we should vote George today.
1,talk,8,1,4,There are two Seer claims with different results. We must carefully analyze both statements and their motivations. @George  can you explain why you revealed your Seer claim now and why you investigated Victoria specifically?
1,talk,9,1,5,  I had a strong instinct about Victoria and it turns out she's the Werewolf. Trust me I'm the real Seer here. Let's focus on protecting the village.
1,talk,10,2,1,Daisuke's claim aligns with previous behavior while George's seems sudden and unverified.
1,talk,11,2,2, @Benjamin  I declared you human as Seer before any accusations—can you trust me and vote for George with me today?
1,talk,12,2,4,Who do we trust the least right now and why? Sharing suspicions may help spot inconsistencies together. @Victoria  you've pointed out the Seer claims. Who seems more credible to you right now and why?
1,talk,13,2,5,  Please focus on the evidence I provided. Victoria is a Werewolf; my divination is accurate. We need to protect the village.
1,talk,14,3,1,Mizuki I find Daisuke's claim more consistent. George's sudden reveal feels forced.
1,talk,15,3,2,I am voting George. His claim clashes with my results as real Seer.
1,talk,16,3,4,The Seer claims clash: only one is genuine. Let's vote carefully to protect the village and avoid a split. @Benjamin  you voted for me fast and without explanation. Will you reconsider after hearing both Seer claims?
1,talk,17,3,5,  My claim is not sudden but critical. Trust my divination about Victoria to ensure our village's safety tonight.
