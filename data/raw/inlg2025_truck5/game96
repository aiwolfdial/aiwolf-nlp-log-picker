1,talk,1,0,5,You call me suspicious for pointing out your mistake. A transparent deflection Mio.
1,talk,2,0,1,Acting rashly helps wolves hide. Let’s focus on steady discussion and examine everyone not just CO results.
1,talk,3,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Shizue and Shizue was a human.
1,talk,4,0,3,I'd like to clarify there seems to be some confusion. I divined Victoria last night and she is human.
1,talk,5,1,4,Two seer claims conflict: Victoria says Shizue is human; Shizue says Victoria is human. At least one claim is false.  @Victoria  State which night you divined  the exact result  and how you will prove it later. Shizue  state the same. If no verifiable seer/medium proof by midday I wi
1,talk,6,1,5,A Seer and a Possessed. Leave them for today. Mio your loud mistakes yesterday make you stand out.
1,talk,7,1,1,With two seer claims and conflicting info let’s not risk losing the real seer too early. Focus on calmer deduction.
1,talk,8,1,2,I will vote Mio.
1,talk,9,1,3,I am the real Seer. My divination shows Victoria is human; however she falsely claims to be Seer which makes her suspicious.
1,talk,10,2,4, @Victoria  State the exact night you divined  the target  and the result now and explain how you will prove it later. Shizue reports divining you as human; that spec
1,talk,11,2,5,The Seer-Possessed pair is a distraction. The wolf is in the grey. Mio's erratic behavior is the only lead.
1,talk,12,2,1, @Mio  your explanations have been overly forceful. Werewolves thrive under confusion. Let’s consider voting you out now.
1,talk,13,2,2,Over
1,talk,14,2,3, My insight as Seer is reliable. Victoria's false claim is a major red flag for us. Focus on this discrepancy to ensure our safety.

1,talk,16,3,5,The case against Mio is clear. Their chaos benefits the wolf. My vote is for Mio.
1,talk,17,3,1,I'll vote  @Mio  today—her actions are causing too much confusion. We need clarity to catch the real wolf.
1,talk,18,3,3,My ability reveals the truth. Victoria claims to be Seer yet falsely so. Vote Victoria—a critical move for villagers.

2,talk,0,0,5,The attack on Victoria confirmed she was the Seer. That means you are the wolf Mizuki. It's over.
2,talk,1,0,3,Shion I must insist you vote Mizuki. My divination confirms Mizuki is a Werewolf. This is our best chance for a Villager victory.
2,talk,2,0,1, @Shizue  your divination feels staged. Two people acting so certain is suspicious. Are you collaborating behind the scenes?
2,talk,3,1,5,It's not collaboration Mizuki. It's cold logic. Victoria's death signed your warrant.
2,talk,4,1,3,Shion voting for Mizuki is essential. My divination proves she's the werewolf ensuring our village's survival rests on this action.
2,talk,5,1,1, @Shion  are you truly sure about Shizue’s results? If she’s Possessed her claim ends the game for us instantly.
2,talk,6,2,5,A Possessed's claim is irrelevant. Your votes are what matter. Checkmate.
2,talk,7,2,3,Shion I deeply urge you to vote Mizuki today. Based on my divination Mizuki is definitively a Werewolf.
2,talk,8,2,1, @Shion   if Shizue is Possessed her result could doom us. Isn’t her sudden certainty after Victoria too suspicious?
2,talk,9,3,5,Your final struggle is pointless Mizuki. The board is already set. Just end it.
2,talk,10,3,3,Shion I'm relying on your judgment here. Let's secure a win by voting for Mizuki today; she's clearly the Werewolf.
