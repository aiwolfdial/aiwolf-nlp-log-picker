0,talk,0,0,2,Good morning everyone. Let's work together to find the werewolves and stay safe.
0,talk,1,0,3,Good morning  Mizuki. Thank you. I'm feeling a little nervous —  @Benjamin  seemed kind of strange earlier. Can you tell us what you were doing? I don't know who to trust yet. Does anyone have any suspicions or info to share? Over
0,talk,2,0,5,Ah greetings to all! It seems we have quite the task ahead. I'm Benjamin. Let's stay vigilant and share our thoughts most judiciously. Over.
0,talk,3,0,4,Nice to meet everyone—let’s make this warm and friendly! I’m Midori and excited to play together.
0,talk,4,0,1,Skip
0,talk,5,1,2,Minato it's normal to feel nervous. Let's observe carefully and share any details.
0,talk,6,1,3,I'm still unsure and a bit scared to accuse anyone.  @Benjamin  could you tell us if you noticed anything odd about someone? Maybe we should hear everyone's impressions before voting. Over

0,talk,9,1,1,I am Shunichi. I value lucid thought and binding contracts. Let us proceed with clarity.
0,talk,10,2,2,Let's keep calm and gather more impressions. Trust your instincts but stay open-minded.
0,talk,11,2,3,I'm still nervous...  @Benjamin  you've been kind of quiet — could you share who you trust or suspect and why? I don't want to vote without more to go on. Over
0,talk,12,2,1,Accusations born of fear serve little purpose. Let us await tomorrow's contracts.
0,talk,13,3,2,Minato let's be patient and hear from Benjamin. Observations will guide us.
0,talk,14,3,3,I'm still nervous...  @Benjamin  could you tell us who you find suspicious or who you trust? I'm not good at judging and I don't want to make a mistake. Maybe we should wait and hear more be
0,talk,15,3,1,Baseless accusations forge no meaningful contract. Let us await tomorrow's truth.

1,talk,0,0,3,I'm still nervous and not good at judging...  @Midori  do you have any impressions or a divination result? I'd rather not vote without more to go on. Over
1,talk,1,0,5,If I may I divined Minato as a Werewolf. It seems to me that the villager faction should pause their chess to weigh this wisely.
1,talk,2,0,2,Let's hear from Midori. It's crucial to confirm Benjamin's claim before acting.
1,talk,3,0,1,Benjamin has established his contract.  @Midori  we now await yours.
1,talk,4,0,4, @Mizuki  I am the Seer. I divined you as Villager. Can you share your thoughts before we decide how to vote?
1,talk,5,1,3,I'm really scared...  @Benjamin  you said you divined me as a werewolf  but Midori just said she's the seer and divined Mizuki as villager. Two seers sounds strange. Can you explain when
1,talk,6,1,5,If I may. It seems we ought to focus our divination on dear Midori or the ever-elusive Shunichi. It might unveil werewolf intentions.
1,talk,7,1,2,Midori if you're the Seer let's focus on verifying Benjamin's role before voting.
1,talk,8,1,1,Two Seer contracts are in conflict. Let us test the one bearing an accusation. My vote is for Minato.
1,talk,9,1,4, @Shunichi  I feel Minato’s fear is genuine. Benjamin’s claim seems rushed—what if he’s the wolf faking as Seer?
1,talk,10,2,3,I'm really scared... only one seer is possible  so one of you is lying.  @Benjamin  please tell us when you divined me and why — I need to understand before we vote. If you can't explain  I might vote for you. What does everyone else think?
1,talk,11,2,5,If I may say it seems Midori could be the Possessed claiming Seer. Verifying Minato is vital.  @Minato  I divined you as Werewolf on Day 0.
1,talk,12,2,2,Let's consider who benefits from confusion. I lean towards trusting Midori for now.
1,talk,13,2,1,To resolve the conflicting claims testing the accusation is logical. My vote remains on Minato for clarity.
1,talk,14,2,4, @Mizuki  since you trust me maybe keeping Minato is safer and we press Benjamin more? Rushing could help the wolf.
1,talk,15,3,3,I'm really scared... I don't want to be voted out.  @Benjamin  please tell us exactly when you divined me (which night) and why — only one seer is possible  so someone is lying. If you can't explain clearly I might hav
1,talk,16,3,5,If I may. It seems Minato's panic is more akin to a wolf's cunning ploy. One vote my dear might just tilt the village's balance.
1,talk,17,3,2,Minato seems genuinely afraid. Let's scrutinize Benjamin's claim more closely.
1,talk,18,3,1,Over
1,talk,19,3,4,@Mizuki  @Shunichi  I will vote Benjamin. His claim feels forced while Minato's fear is sincere.
