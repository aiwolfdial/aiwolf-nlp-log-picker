0,talk,10,2,3,Let's focus on gathering info. Minako any thoughts on Yumi's claim? George still waiting on you.
0,talk,11,2,5,Yumi’s villager claim is unverified—can you explain what made you claim that now? Shion  any tentative vote or reads?  @George  you’ve been very quiet—please speak up and state any role or your read. Daisuke  who are you leaning toward voting?

0,talk,13,3,5, @George  you've been very quiet — please state your role and your read now. If you keep silent  that will make you more suspicious. Yumi  why claim villager so earl

1,talk,2,0,4,Um... I... I am the seer. My divination result... well it reveals that Ms. Minako is a werewolf. Just so you know.
1,talk,3,0,2,I will vote Minako.
1,talk,4,0,3,Daisuke's claim is bold. Minako any defense? George your silence is concerning.
1,talk,5,1,5,I'm the seer. I divined  @Daisuke  on night 0 — he is HUMAN. Daisuke is lying about being the seer and accusing me. Yumi  don't vote me. Daisuke  explain your claim. Over
1,talk,6,1,1,...
1,talk,7,1,4,Um... I'm sticking to my vote Mr. Minako's claim seems um not sincere. This might show our roles. Any thoughts before I use divination?
1,talk,8,1,2,I will vote Minako.
1,talk,9,1,3,We're in a tough spot. Minako or Daisuke is lying. George your input is crucial now.
1,talk,10,2,5,I’m the real seer. I divined  @Daisuke  on night 0 — he’s HUMAN. Daisuke is lying about being seer. Shion  George  Yumi — what are your votes now? Daisuke  explain your divination (target and nig
1,talk,11,2,1,...
1,talk,12,2,4,Um... I think Ms. Minako might be the werewolf. It's scary with the silence. Mr. George? Could you share what you think too?
1,talk,13,2,2,I will vote Minako.
1,talk,14,2,3,Minako your claim is bold. George we need your insights. I'm leaning towards Minako.
1,talk,15,3,5, @Daisuke  explain your seer claim now: which night and who did you divine? I divined you on night 0 — HUMAN. If you can’t explain  I’ll vote for you. Shion  Yumi  Georg

1,talk,17,3,4,Um Ms. Minako's claims... they feel a bit scattered don't they? Maybe... we should question them more. It just seems a bit off.
1,talk,18,3,2,I will vote Minako.
1,talk,19,3,3,Daisuke's point is valid. Minako why the inconsistency? George any thoughts?

2,talk,0,0,4,Um. Mr. George is well a werewolf. I divined him last night. Maybe we could you know unite and vote together against him?
2,talk,1,0,3,Daisuke your claim is noted. George any defense or should we trust Daisuke's word?
2,talk,2,0,1,...
2,talk,3,1,4,Um. I got Mr. George as Werewolf. Ms. Minako was suspicious. Voting shook it up. Um. Shion. What do you think of his silence?
2,talk,4,1,3,George's silence is troubling. We might need to trust Daisuke and focus our vote there.
2,talk,5,1,1,...
2,talk,6,2,4,Um... Ms. Yumi's silence... it's well intriguing. Maybe I should divine Mr. Shion tonight? Minako is gone... and who's George's partner? Balance..
2,talk,7,2,3,Daisuke focus on George for now. We need to confirm his role first.
2,talk,8,2,1,...
2,talk,9,3,4,Well... if we don't choose Mr. George maybe Ms. Minako is right. We could be risking all the villagers. It's... unsettling.
2,talk,10,3,3,Daisuke I understand your concern but George's silence is a bigger risk now.
