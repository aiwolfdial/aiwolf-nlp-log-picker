0,talk,2,0,3,Takumi here. I'm Seer. No result yet; will report D1. No mass-claim. Mizuki's Skip is bad. Speak. I won't give up. @Mizuki  why skip? Give role thoughts. If town help now. If you stall I vote you D1. I'm Seer. No N0. Let's figure it out.

1,talk,3,0,1, I divined Takumi last night as Seer and the result showed he is the Werewolf. We need to focus our strategy around this information.
1,talk,4,0,5,Mizuki. Seer. My intel from last night: Ryuji is Human. The threat is one of the other two claimants.
1,talk,5,1,4,Two seer claims conflict: you assert I am Human while Rin reports Takumi as Werewolf. One or both are false.  @Mizuki  Provide exact N0 target details and how you verified your result now. If you cannot produce verifiable information I will vote to lynch you. Over
1,talk,6,1,2, @Takumi  You CO’d Seer but haven’t given a divination. Who did you divine and what was the result? Please answer now.
1,talk,7,1,3,My N0: Mizuki is Wolf. Rin's red on me is poss bluff. 'Ryuji human' is pocketing. I vote Mizuki today. I won't give up. @Servas N0: Mizuki is Wolf. That's my result. Rin is likely possessed. I will vote Mizuki today. Let's figure it out.
1,talk,8,1,1,I retract my Seer CO. I'm not the Seer I used that claim to gather reactions. I think Takumi might be a Werewolf based on his interactions.
1,talk,9,1,5,The board is set. Three claimants mean the Seer Possessed and Wolf are among us. The threat is here.
1,talk,10,2,4, @Mizuki  Provide the exact N0 target and method for your Seer result now. You claimed Ryuji Human — state whether that was a divination and if you were roleblock
1,talk,11,2,2, @Mizuki  your late CO felt forced. Wolves often hesitate. Why did you wait until pressured to declare Seer?
1,talk,12,2,3,Mizuki's late claim and 'Ryuji Human' feel fake. Real Seer gives exact N0 fast. My vote stays on Mizuki. @Mizuki  name your N0 target when you chose and why Ryuji. If you can't you're the wolf. Talk now.
1,talk,13,2,1,Vote for Takumi today. My earlier claim was false to test responses which revealed inconsistencies in Takumi's behavior suggesting he's the Werewo
1,talk,14,2,5,Consider the enemy's goal. They create this chaos. My intel is the only constant: Ryuji is human.

1,talk,16,3,2,I trust Takumi’s clear claim over Mizuki’s late CO. Wolves dodge questions. My vote is Mizuki. Let’s end this cleanly.
1,talk,17,3,3,Skip
1,talk,18,3,1,I retracted my Seer claim to see how Takumi would react. His aggressive defense and quick shifts seem off. Vote for Takumi.

2,talk,1,0,2, @Takumi  since you claimed Seer and said Mizuki was Wolf why isn’t the game over? Explain your view directly.
2,talk,2,0,4, @Servas  Reveal your role now. With no verified seer result and only two players left  lynching risks a mislynch. Propose we skip to night to let actions resolve

2,talk,4,1,2,Takumi your Wolf claim on Mizuki didn’t end the game—I suspect you’re faking Seer. Explain yourself now.
2,talk,5,1,4,Two players remaining.  @Servas  reveal your role now. If you refuse  I will vote to skip to night to force role actions rather than risk a mislynch; skipping benefits wolves. State role

2,talk,7,2,2,Takumi’s Seer claim doesn’t add up since the game continues.  @Takumi  why should I trust you’re not the real wolf?

2,talk,9,3,3,I faked Seer to bait the wolf. The Mizuki red was a trap. Ryuji wants no-lynch at 3p. That’s wolfy. I vote Ryuji. @Ryuji Your skip plan hands the wolf a win. Claim now. Why no-lynch at 3p? That’s bad. I’m voting you. I won’t give up.
2,talk,10,3,2,Takumi faked Seer and tried to mislead us twice. I’m voting Takumi. Ryuji your pressure is harsh but logical.
2,talk,11,3,4, @Servas  Reveal your role now. If you refuse I will vote to skip to night to force role actions; skipping is preferable to a risky lynch. Over
