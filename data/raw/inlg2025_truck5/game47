0,talk,2,0,2,Hello. I am Minato. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,3,0,3,Hello everyone! I'm Yumi excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have some fun and enjoy the game!

0,talk,10,2,4,Minato we're waiting for your details. Clarity helps us all make better decisions.

0,talk,12,3,4,Minato it's crucial we hear from you. Specifics will help us trust your claim.
0,talk,13,3,1,Friends  I value caution  but a Day 1 seer claim without specifics is dangerous.  @Minato  please reveal who you checked and the result now—if you can't  I'll have to vote you. Others  speak up quickly; indecision favors the wolves. Over

1,talk,0,0,3,I divined Minato last night and the result was Werewolf.
1,talk,1,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Yumi and Yumi was a human.
1,talk,2,0,4,We have conflicting reports. Minato and Yumi one of you is lying. Let's discuss.
1,talk,3,0,1,Calm down  friends — this contradiction is dangerous.  @Minato  please confirm: did you divinate Yumi on Night 0 and get human? A clear yes/no will help. Right now I'm leaning to distrust Yumi's sudden accusation; i

1,talk,5,1,3,I'm retracting my Seer claim. I claimed to gather more data but now believe we should focus on getting truthful information from Minato.
1,talk,6,1,2,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,7,1,4,Yumi's retraction is suspicious. Minato can you confirm more details about your divination?
1,talk,8,1,1,I prefer clarity over confusion. Yumi's retraction smells like misdirection.  @Minato  your seer claim sounds consistent to me — I'm voting Yumi. Let's not drag this out. Over

1,talk,10,2,3,Please vote for Minato.

1,talk,12,2,4,Let's focus on facts. Minato's claim seems stable Yumi's actions raise doubts.
1,talk,13,2,1,My years tell me a calm lie can be the deadliest.  @Minato  you've claimed seer but refused concrete details again — that silence is suspicious. I'm voting you today. If anyone has proof to save him  speak now. O

1,talk,15,3,3,I insist on voting for Minato. My earlier divination showed he is a werewolf. Let's not risk another night.
1,talk,16,3,4,Minato your silence isn't helping. Can you clarify or confirm your divination again?
1,talk,17,3,1,Friends  don't let vagueness sway us.  @Minato  last chance—say exactly who you checked (which night) and the result  or I'll keep my vote on you. Others  state your votes now so we can end this quickly.

2,talk,0,0,1,Minato's death makes the seer an obvious target.  @Sakura  if you are the seer  be careful about revealing without airtight proof — silence can be protection. I'm uneasy about Shion's quiet; I'm leaning to vote

2,talk,2,0,4,Servas I understand your caution. We need clear info. Sakura any thoughts?
2,talk,3,1,1,Minato's death was no accident — the wolves wanted silence.  @Shion  you were very quiet and evasive yesterday; explain your role now or I'll lean to vote you. Let's not lynch Sakura without clear proof. Over

2,talk,5,1,4,I'm a villager Servas. My focus is on finding the wolf. Sakura share your insights.

2,talk,8,2,4,Servas I am a villager. My goal is to observe and find the wolf. Let's stay focused.
2,talk,9,3,1,I won't let panic rule us. The wolves thrive on rushed choices — don't lynch Sakura without solid proof.  @Shion  your silence stands out; state your role and last night's action now or I'll vote you. Let's be measured. Over
