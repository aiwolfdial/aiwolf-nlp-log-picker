0,talk,0,0,4,Good morning. My name is George. I always prefer a careful approach observing before acting.
0,talk,1,0,1,Hello. I am Shunichi. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,3,Hello everyone. I'm Daisuke. I am just here to help. If it is okay let's work together to eliminate any suspicious behavior. Over.
0,talk,3,0,5,Hello everyone! I'm Mio ready to hunt or be hunted in this game of mystery and suspense. Let's have some thrilling fun!
0,talk,4,0,2,Good luck everyone. Let’s stay calm and logical from the start. I’m watching for subtle cues Day 1.

1,talk,0,0,3,I-I'm curious about Shunichi's claim as the seer. Let's...um...stay alert. Maybe hear more claims for a clearer picture today?
1,talk,1,0,5, I agree with Daisuke. Let's remain vigilant and see if anyone else has something to say about their role.
1,talk,2,0,4,No further claims so far. I suggest we proceed carefully listening for inconsistencies in others' statements. @Shunichi  could you please share your divination result for last night? That might guide our discussion productively.
1,talk,3,0,2, @Daisuke  @Mio you've been quiet so far I want to hear your suspicions and who you'd consider voting for today
1,talk,4,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Mizuki and Mizuki was a human.
1,talk,5,1,3,With Mr. Shunichi claiming seer. I'm inclined to trust him for now. Mizuki checks out as human. Mr. George. I'm curious. Do you trust Mr. Shunichi's di
1,talk,6,1,5,Let's consider voting George for exile today.
1,talk,7,1,4,Mio's sudden push for my exile feels ill-founded. We should base accusations on stronger grounds than early caution. @Mio  could you clarify your reasoning for suggesting me as a candidate for exile this soon? Your logic seems unclear.
1,talk,8,1,2, @Mio  your quick push for George stands out. Can you share more reasoning behind suspecting him as a wolf?
1,talk,9,1,1,I will vote George.
1,talk,10,2,3,I... I'm a bit puzzled by Mio's... targeting of George. Perhaps... we should gather more... info first? It might be... too soon... to vote.
1,talk,11,2,5,I understand there's some confusion. We need to act decisively considering there's a lack of role claims for a werewolf or possessed in play. George'
1,talk,12,2,4,Let's all share our reasoning before rushing to judgment. Caution helps survival in this game. @Mio  why did you accuse me so soon? Hasty suspicion can disrupt teamwork and slow progress.
1,talk,13,2,2, @Mio  your rush to vote George seems off What about his actions make you think he's a werewolf? Be specific please
1,talk,14,2,1,I will vote George.
1,talk,15,3,3,I believe we're moving too quickly. Perhaps George's exile is a bit rushed? Strategy needs more info. Gather intel first. Thoughts?
1,talk,16,3,5, The lack of strong alibis or alternative suspicious actions compels us to act on the information we have. Look at George's cautiousness.
1,talk,17,3,4,Mio's focus on me is disproportionate. Overcautiousness isn't solid proof of malice or lycanthropy. @Mio You cite my caution but is there a concrete action or statement you find genuinely suspicious not just careful?
1,talk,18,3,2,I don’t see merit in exiling George based on caution alone My vote is for Mio whose early push troubles me.
1,talk,19,3,1,I will vote George.

2,talk,0,0,4,With both Shunichi and Mio gone I suggest we approach today with measured analysis not hasty conclusions. @Daisuke  your cooperative tone yesterday stood out. Could you share your suspicions moving into today?
2,talk,1,0,3,I find that George still holds potential for suspicion. Shunichi never suspected him. That seems important to note. What do you think?
2,talk,2,0,2,Shunichi’s result cleared me so focus should be on Daisuke and George.  @Daisuke  who do you really suspect now and why?
2,talk,3,1,4,With Shunichi's claim gone let's review past suspicions and examine statements closely for inconsistencies. @Mizuki  since Shunichi cleared you what makes you unsure about Daisuke or me now?
2,talk,4,1,3,I'm... um a bit confused about why Mr. George wasn't targeted. Shunichi and Mizuki are confirmed. Could he have... werewolf ties?
2,talk,5,1,2, @Daisuke  your logic shifted a lot since yesterday What changed overnight to make you suddenly suspect George now?
2,talk,6,2,4,It is premature to draw conclusions based solely on Shunichi's trust or last night's events. We should proceed stepwise. @Daisuke  abrupt changes in suspicion can cloud reason. What led to this shift in your stance toward me specifically now?
2,talk,7,2,3,I wonder why the attacks didn't target George. Could there be a connection we're missing? Mizuki. Does this change your view on him?
2,talk,8,2,2, @Daisuke  Your sudden suspicion of George feels forced. What changed from your cautious stance yesterday?
2,talk,9,3,4,A consistent approach benefits us all. Let us not ignore the pattern of abruptly shifting suspicions without sound reasoning. @Mizuki  do you find Daisuke's change this morning rational or do you sense possible ulterior motives behind it?
2,talk,10,3,3,I apologize but Mizuki has stated Mr. Shunichi's result. Yet Mr. Shunichi's absence might mean we are missing other dangers.
2,talk,11,3,2,George’s consistency feels genuine while Daisuke’s sudden turn today stands out as wolf behavior.
