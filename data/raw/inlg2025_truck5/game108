0,talk,0,0,2,Hello everyone! I'm George excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have fun and uncover the mystery together!
0,talk,1,0,1,Skip
0,talk,2,0,3,Let's work together to identify any suspicious behavior. Trust and communication are key.
0,talk,3,0,4,Morning. I have no claim.  @George  you came out strong — any role or reads to share? Kenji skipped and Ryuji was vague; I'd like to hear concrete thoughts before any votes. Over
0,talk,4,0,5,Hey everyone! I'm Takumi. Let's jump into this game! Trust is key. Keep talking and we'll sniff out those werewolves together!
0,talk,5,1,2,Over
0,talk,6,1,1,I'm Kenji! Ready for an adventure! Let's do our best and win this together team
0,talk,7,1,3,I have no specific reads yet Jonathan. Let's stay observant and share any insights.
0,talk,8,1,4,I have no role to claim yet.  @George  you stayed quiet — any reads or plans? If there's nothing concrete  I'd rather we skip voting today and gather more info. Over

0,talk,11,2,3,I agree Jonathan. Gathering more information today could be more beneficial for us.
0,talk,12,2,4,I don't want a rushed lynch with so little info. I'll stay quiet and observant for now — let's skip today.  @George   do you want to add anything? Over
0,talk,13,3,3,Let's stay cautious and gather as much information as we can today.
0,talk,14,3,4,I agree — let's skip and gather info. If anyone plans to claim a role or has concrete reads  speak now.  @George  any thoughts? Over

1,talk,0,0,1,Adventure time! I'm the Seer! My vision showed Takumi is a HUMAN! He's on our team
1,talk,1,0,3,Thanks for sharing Kenji. Let's focus on finding the werewolves among us now.
1,talk,2,0,2,I divined Ryuji last night and he is also human. We should focus our suspicions on others.
1,talk,3,0,4,Two seer claims now — one of them must be lying.  @Kenji  exactly when did you divine Takumi? Please give details (which night  timing). Over
1,talk,4,0,5,Kenji says I'm human. But I did my divination! He's a WEREWOLF! Let's talk about who to trust. George what do you think?
1,talk,5,1,1,Whoa 3 seers?! My vision said Takumi is HUMAN! He must be the Possessed trying to frame me
1,talk,6,1,3,We need to carefully assess each claim. Let's hear more details from everyone involved.
1,talk,7,1,2,Consider the evidence and Takumi's divination which points to Kenji being a werewolf. We should vote for Kenji to protect the village.
1,talk,8,1,4,Three seer claims now — one of them is lying.  @Kenji  when exactly did you divine Takumi (which night)? You still haven't answered. His divination that you’re a werewolf and your "Takumi human" don't li
1,talk,9,1,5,Kenji's claim is false. I divined he's a werewolf! George was right about Ryuji. Hey Jonathan. Kenji was caught! Let's vote Kenji!
1,talk,10,2,1,Takumi is HUMAN my vision was clear! He must be the Possessed! So George is the wolf! Let's vote George
1,talk,11,2,3,The conflicting claims are confusing. Let's analyze each one carefully before deciding.
1,talk,12,2,2,I request everyone to vote for Kenji today. Takumi’s divination points to him as a werewolf. If we do not act villagers might lose.
1,talk,13,2,4, @Kenji  restate your divination (which night  exact result) — your claim and George's don't match. I’ll vote Kenji unless someone gives a convincing explana
1,talk,14,2,5,Listen up! I’ve shown Kenji’s a werewolf. We gotta unite and vote him out. Anything else? Too risky! No worries. I’ve got this!
1,talk,15,3,1,My vision saw Takumi is HUMAN! That makes him the Possessed and George is the Werewolf! We have to vote for George!
1,talk,16,3,3,We need to decide soon. I lean towards trusting George and Takumi's claims for now.
1,talk,17,3,2, I am urging you all again vote for Kenji. Kenji's claim doesn't hold up while we have consistent intel pointing to him as a werewolf.
1,talk,18,3,4, @Kenji  which night did you divine Takumi? Your claim still conflicts with George's result. I'm voting Kenji — anyone else joining me? Over
1,talk,19,3,5,Kenji's saying George is a werewolf huh? Sounds desperate to me. We caught him! Are we risking everything by ignoring it? @Ryuji Ryuji. Two seers say Kenji's a wolf. We gotta act fast! Don't doubt them. It could be bad for the village! Let's go!

2,talk,0,0,5,Hey guys. Listen up. As the Seer I divined and it’s pretty clear. Ryuji is the Werewolf! Let's stick together and handle this.
2,talk,1,0,4,Only three of us left — we need a quick decision.  @Takumi   claim your role or give a clear read now. If you stay silent I’ll vote to lynch you. Ryuji  what do you think? Over
2,talk,2,0,3,I believe Takumi might be misleading us. We need to consider all possibilities.
2,talk,3,1,5,Alright gang! Listen up! Ryuji is playing safe which screams werewolf to me. Let's vote for Ryuji today and secure this win!
2,talk,4,1,4,Three of us left.  @Takumi  claim your role now or I'll vote to lynch you. Ryuji  what's your read? We need to decide quickly. Over
2,talk,5,1,3,Jonathan I believe Takumi is trying to mislead us. Let's think this through.
2,talk,6,2,5,I've divined. I'm the real Seer! Ryuji's my suspect. Trust me! Stay united. Ryuji! You think I'm misleading? What's your role huh?
2,talk,7,2,4,This is the last round.  @Takumi  claim your role now or I'll vote you. Ryuji — what's your read? We must decide quickly. Over
2,talk,8,2,3,Jonathan I am a villager. Takumi's claim seems suspicious. Let's think carefully.
2,talk,9,3,5,Jonathan! Ryuji's timing is weird right? I've noticed it. His insistence. Too convenient. No worries I'll keep an eye on him! @Jonathan Hey Jonathan! Ryuji's acting super sketchy. Didn't you see? His timing is way too perfect. I've got this! Let's keep an eye on him!
2,talk,10,3,4, @Takumi  claim your role now or I'll vote you. Ryuji — what's your read? If we don't get anything convincing I'll vote Takumi. Over
2,talk,11,3,3,Jonathan Takumi's focus on me seems forced. I suggest we vote for Takumi.
