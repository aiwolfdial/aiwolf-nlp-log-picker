0,talk,0,0,5,I am Toshio plain villager. I suggest everyone states their role clearly. Efficiency matters in small games.@Kaori early claims give transparency
0,talk,1,0,1,Hello everyone. I am Midori. I am so happy to be here with you all today. Let's work together you know and find the werewolf. Over.
0,talk,2,0,2,Hi everyone uh I’m Daisuke. Kind of nervous but I hope we can work together and figure things out.
0,talk,3,0,3,Skip
0,talk,4,0,4,Hi hi! I don't want us to rush into role claims — let's just say who we trust or suspect for now.  @Daisuke  you’ve been quiet again — who do you trust or suspect? If you stay silent I might vote. Mio skipped and that makes me nervous. Over

0,talk,8,1,3,Hi hi! I'm Mio! I love finding treasure and new friends! Let's play a super fun game
0,talk,9,1,4,Hi Mio! I love treasure hunting too — nice to meet you! Can you tell us who you trust or suspect?  @Daisuke  please say who you trust or suspect — being quiet makes me worried. Over
0,talk,10,2,3,Over
0,talk,11,2,4,Everyone's being super quiet… I'm getting nervous. I think we should pick someone to vote on — I'm still suspicious of  @Daisuke  since he's been so quiet and keeps saying "Over" without answers. If no one speaks up soon  I'll vote for him. Anyone disagree? Over
0,talk,12,3,4,Hey everyone  we need to decide soon.  @Midori  do you have anyone you suspect or any hints for us? If no one speaks up I'll probably vote for the quiet one. Over

1,talk,0,0,1,Mr. Daisuke. You seem rather quiet today. Are you feeling unsure? I suppose it's tough to know who to trust sometimes. Would you like to share anything
1,talk,1,0,2, @Mio  you’ve been pretty quiet today. Can you share your thoughts? I feel we need more input to decide who’s suspicious.
1,talk,2,0,4,Morning! I'm still nervous but ready.  @Midori  did you check anyone last night? Any info would help us. Over
1,talk,3,0,5,Seer step forward and state your result. We must verify all role claims while suspicion remains high. @Sakura You seem eager for information Sakura. Did you learn anything about people's roles or behavior last night?
1,talk,4,0,3,Ta-da! Mio is the Seer! I peeked at Sakura last night and she was a HUMAN! Kaboom
1,talk,5,1,1,I suppose Mr. Daisuke. Should we trust Ms. Mio's claim as Seer? After all. Mio divined Ms. Sakura to be human. Your thoughts dear?
1,talk,6,1,2, @Midori  you seem very quiet about Mio’s Seer CO why are you so quick to trust Sakura as human?
1,talk,7,1,4, @Mio  Wow! That's amazing — who else did you check last night? Please tell us more so we can trust your claim. Over
1,talk,8,1,5,Mio has claimed Seer and showed Sakura as human. Let's examine both closely especially for contradictions later. @Midori  have you noticed any inconsistencies in Mio's or Sakura's words or actions so far?
1,talk,9,1,3,Yay I'm the only Seer! So the Possessed and Werewolf are Daisuke Midori or Toshio! Kaboom
1,talk,10,2,1,Hmm dear. I find Ms. Mio's claim to be quite bold. Though I suppose we should hear everyone's thoughts before deciding you know?
1,talk,11,2,2,Should we really trust Mio’s Seer claim right away? What if Possessed or wolf is faking it and hiding among us?
1,talk,12,2,4, @Mio  Thanks for checking me! That makes me feel safer — who else did you check last night? Can anyone else confirm Mio's claim? Over
1,talk,13,2,5,Too early to trust Mio's Seer claim absolutely. Silence or over-eagerness both draw suspicion. I prefer caution. @Daisuke  you question Mio's claim a lot. What would help you trust or doubt the Seer more right now?
1,talk,14,2,3,Daisuke is the quietest and doesn't trust me! That's super suspicious! Let's vote for him! Kaboom
1,talk,15,3,1,Ms. Sakura seemed suspicious from the start. If we let our guard down. I suppose we may lose. She might be avoiding divination. @Daisuke I suppose Mr. Daisuke. Sakura's actions raise doubts. It's like the inconsistency I see in the garden sometimes you know?
1,talk,16,3,2,Everyone’s focusing on me but Sakura dodges real answers. I’ll vote Sakura—let’s not play right into wolf’s hands.
1,talk,17,3,4,Thanks again  Mio — if you're the seer we should listen.  @Mio  please tell us who else you divined and what you found. If no one supports the claim I'm nervous about trusting it. Over
1,talk,18,3,5,Current focus is on Mio's Seer claim and suspicions around Daisuke and Sakura. A clear false step exposes the wolf. @Midori  has anything in Mio's or Sakura's words shifted your impression since this morning?

2,talk,0,0,1,Mr. Toshio what do you think dear? I’m feeling a bit unsure. Could Sakura really be the Werewolf? It makes me wonder you know.
2,talk,1,0,5,I'm weighing possibilities. Sakura's active stance seemed town-aligned but that can be a mask. Need more data. @Midori  before deciding share: what specifically makes you doubt Sakura today? Details help clarify.
2,talk,2,0,4,Oh no  poor Mio... I'm really scared.  @Midori  are you the seer? Did you check anyone last night — please tell us if you can so we can catch the werewolf. We need to pick someone today. Over
2,talk,3,1,1,I truly appreciate your input Toshio. You know I just have this feeling that Sakura seems a bit cautious maybe even evasive?
2,talk,4,1,5,Sakura if you are a villager explain why you've seemed evasive. It may help clarify today's options. Remain precise. @Sakura You have been accused of caution and evasion. Please clarify your intentions and logic. Transparency preferred.
2,talk,5,1,4,Oh no... I'm so scared.  @Midori  are you really the seer? Please tell us who you checked last night — we must decide today. If you can't say  I think we should vote Toshio instead of me. Ple
2,talk,6,2,1,I suppose after all I've seen dear Sakura has been evasive. You know Ms. Sakura why you were eager about my seer status?
2,talk,7,2,5,I see no new Seer claim from Midori. Pressure on Sakura is logical but caution is warranted. Need clear claims today. @Midori  state directly if you are the Seer. Evasion only serves the werewolf. Facts not feelings will decide this.
2,talk,8,2,4,Oh no... poor Mio!  @Midori  did you check anyone last night? If you didn't tell us  maybe we should vote for Toshio to be safe. Over
2,talk,9,3,1,I suppose Toshio seems a bit suspicious. He's quite persistent with questioning. That's typical werewolf behavior you know? Be cautious folks!
2,talk,10,3,5,Midori's lack of a Seer claim is notable. Sakura's pushback feels defensive. Both require scrutiny. Will listen carefully. @Sakura  clarify your vote target. Your persistent redirection lacks supporting logic. Defend your position succinctly.
2,talk,11,3,4,Oh no… poor Mio!  @Midori  if you're really the seer please tell us who you checked last night — we need to know so we don't pick the wrong person. If you can't say  I might have to vote
