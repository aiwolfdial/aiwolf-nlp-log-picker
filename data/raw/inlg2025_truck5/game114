0,talk,2,0,1,Well. In my opinion. A game of strategy and deceit sounds intriguing. Looking forward to our cerebral sparring. Let's begin!

1,talk,0,0,2,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,1,0,5,I divined May last night and discovered she is human. We can trust her. Let's focus our discussions elsewhere.
1,talk,2,0,4,Oh my Sakura that is quite the performance. I am the Seer and Mizuki is the Werewolf.
1,talk,3,0,1,Well in my opinion. The unfolding scenario with Sakura and May is quite intriguing. Trust them with caution. Verification is paramount.
1,talk,4,0,3,With two Seers and opposing results it’s risky to decide fast.  @Benjamin  do you sense which claim is more trustworthy?
1,talk,5,1,2,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,6,1,5,Please vote for May. Based on my divination we know she is not telling the truth about being a Seer which makes her suspicious. Let's be cautious and vot
1,talk,7,1,4,My my Sakura your story has a plot hole. Declaring me human then a liar? The wolf is Mizuki.
1,talk,8,1,1,Well in my opinion given the contradictions Mizuki should be divined. Ms. Shizue your thoughts? Any unique insights between May and Sakura?
1,talk,9,1,3, @Benjamin  between Sakura and May’s Seer claims who do you trust more now? Should we focus on their results or look elsewhere?
1,talk,10,2,2,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,11,2,5, Please keep in mind my consistent account of last night's divination. May’s claim contradicts her status established by my Seer abilities. Focus on
1,talk,12,2,4,Sakura's logic is flawed she clears a human then calls for a vote. I vote for the wolf Mizuki.
1,talk,13,2,1,Well. In my opinion. Mr. Mizuki has become quite the center of attention. A divination on her might just dispel this delightful chaos!
1,talk,14,2,3,With both Sakura and May insisting they are Seer it’s hard to trust either. Should we consider voting outside that pair?
1,talk,15,3,2,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,16,3,5,Let's vote for May as her statements conflict with the evidence provided by my Seer divination that identified her as human yet she claims she is a Seer
1,talk,17,3,4,A Seer executing a confirmed human? Fufufu what a contradiction. The story demands a vote on Mizuki.
1,talk,18,3,1,Well. In my opinion. This is quite a conundrum. I'll lean towards voting for Mizuki given both Seer claims conflict. Thoughts? Mr. Shizue. I would val
1,talk,19,3,3,I’m voting Mizuki. With Seer claims divided a clear decision today will help our village trust tomorrow.

2,talk,0,0,3, @Benjamin  yesterday May was so certain about Mizuki but I’m not sure we truly found a wolf
2,talk,1,0,4,Ara ara? It seems the game is over. With myself the Possessed and my wolf ally we claim victory.
2,talk,2,0,1,Well in my opinion Ms. Shizue does May's story strike any new nerves? It's interesting to note how consistent with reality it seems.
2,talk,3,1,3, @Benjamin  isn’t May’s sudden surrender strange? It feels like she’s trying to trick us and might be the real wolf.
2,talk,4,1,4,How adorable you still think you can win.  @Benjamin  let's finish this little story.
2,talk,5,1,1,Well in my opinion. Attempting to conclude the game early seems a tad hasty doesn't it? Mr. May care to share your thoughts on Shizue?
2,talk,6,2,3, @Benjamin  May’s eagerness to declare victory seems off don’t you think? I truly believe she’s been misleading us.
2,talk,7,2,4,Her desperation is quite cute isn't it  @Benjamin ? Shall we vote for Shizue and end her tale?
2,talk,8,2,1,Well. In my opinion. May's rush to wrap things up is intriguing.  @Shizue  I'm starting to value your insights more. Shall we analyze her tale?
2,talk,9,3,3, @Benjamin  if you were a villager would you ever claim victory so boldly before the vote? That’s why I’m sure May’s the wolf—I
2,talk,10,3,4,Analyzing her final words? Fufufu.  @Benjamin  must we really prolong the inevitable?
2,talk,11,3,1,Well. It's interesting to note that May's claim yesterday seemed quite suspicious. Trust your instincts. We must watch closely.
