0,talk,2,0,1,Hello friends. I'm Shizue. This village feels safe with such warm company. Let's listen kindly to each other today. @Sakura  your cheerful greeting brings a smile. I hope you continue to shine no matter how the debates unfold.
0,talk,3,0,5,Hello. I am Minako. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,4,0,4,I’m Victoria and I don’t trust easily. I watch for what’s unsaid as much as what’s spoken.

1,talk,0,0,4, @Minako  your villager claim was fast—what makes you so sure? Do you have a reason for claiming so early?
1,talk,1,0,5,I will vote Victoria.
1,talk,2,0,2,I checked Minako last night and she is a werewolf. Let's be careful everyone!
1,talk,3,0,1,It's a lovely morning everyone. Sakura quite the assertive claim! I too am the Seer and have my result. @Sakura  it's brave to step forward! For clarity: last night I checked Victoria and saw she is a Villager.
1,talk,4,0,3,Given the circumstances. Ms. Shizue's claim and Ms. Sakura's result do not align. Is Ms. Victoria the target for tonight's confirmation?
1,talk,5,1,4, @Minako  your vote on me felt too quick. Can you explain what pushed you to target me so early?
1,talk,6,1,5,I will vote Shizue.
1,talk,7,1,2,Shizue why claim Seer now? My check on Minako is clear. Let's focus on her.
1,talk,8,1,1,Sometimes when tension rises clarity is even more important. Let's move gently—my vision stands: Victoria is a Villager. @Toshio  your calm makes things easier for all. My check truly revealed Victoria as a Villager. Let's proceed with care.
1,talk,9,1,3,Given the circumstances. Shizue and Sakura should not divinate Ms. Minako or Ms. Victoria again. Perhaps a focus on me is required?
1,talk,10,2,4, @Shizue  Why did you choose to check me on night 0? Was there something in my behavior that stood out to you?
1,talk,11,2,5,Over
1,talk,12,2,2,Toshio I might check you next if it helps clear things up! Let's stay focused.
1,talk,13,2,1,Victoria I chose you night 0 because your words moved me. Calm spirits often reveal much; thank you for asking gently. @Victoria  your question means a lot. I sensed your energy so I trusted where trust felt most guarded.
1,talk,14,2,3,Given the circumstances. I find Ms. Minako's varying votes peculiar. Could her intentions align with the werewolf's strategy? It's plausible.
1,talk,15,3,4,Minako’s shifting votes feel evasive. Sakura’s Seer claim puts the spotlight on Minako—I’ll vote Minako today.
1,talk,16,3,2,Thanks Victoria! Let's focus on Minako and see where it leads us. Trust our instincts!
1,talk,17,3,1,Things feel tense but let’s breathe and think with open minds. Suspicion can cloud gentle hearts so let’s stay calm. @Sakura  your confidence is admirable but certainty can mislead us—let’s walk carefully even when the path feels sure.
1,talk,18,3,3,Given the circumstances. Does Ms. Sakura or Ms. Shizue's Seer claim hold water? Ms. Minako's erratic voting is suspect. Ms. Sakura. If I receive your
