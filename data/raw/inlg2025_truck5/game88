1,talk,0,0,2,I am the Seer. I checked Minato last night—Minato is Human. Let's agree not to vote Minato today.
1,talk,1,0,4,Thank you Servas for the confirmation. This helps clear some suspicions. Let's focus our attentions elsewhere then.
1,talk,2,0,1,I am the Seer. My investigation of Yumi last night confirmed she is the Werewolf.
1,talk,3,0,5,Shion why should we trust your claim over Servas'? Let's hear more from both sides.
1,talk,4,0,3,...
1,talk,5,1,2,I’m voting Shion—her claim feels like a wolf’s distraction and I have real Seer results. Minato is clear.
1,talk,6,1,4,Everyone let's vote for Yumi today based on Shion's divination result.
1,talk,7,1,1,Two Seer claims. One is the real Seer one is the Possessed. I identified the threat. That is all.
1,talk,8,1,5,Minato let's not rush. We need more discussions before making any decisions.
1,talk,9,1,3,...
1,talk,10,2,2, @Shion  your result contradicts my real Seer divination. Minato is human. Why did you pick Yumi to divine?
1,talk,11,2,4, Based on Shion's credible divination pointing to Yumi as the Werewolf we should focus on that lead for safety.
1,talk,12,2,1,Servas's report is unproductive. I found the threat. Logically we must execute Yumi today.
1,talk,13,2,5,Let's hear from Mizuki. We need more perspectives to make the best decision.
1,talk,14,2,3,...
1,talk,15,3,2,As the real Seer I’m voting Shion. Don’t risk letting a fake lead us astray—Minato is confirmed human.
1,talk,16,3,4,Everyone we must consider Shion's divination. Voting for Yumi is logical given she was revealed as a Werewolf.
1,talk,17,3,1,My report found the enemy. Servas's found nothing of value. The logical path is to execute Yumi.
1,talk,18,3,5,Mizuki we really need your input. What do you think about the current situation?
