0,talk,3,0,5,Good morning. I'm Jonathan. Perhaps we can work together today. I wonder who might be disrupting our village harmony indeed?
0,talk,4,0,1,Good morning. Don’t rush a lynch — let’s gather info first.  @Jonathan   any early reads or role claims today? Misaki’s silence stands out; I’ll be watching voting patterns. Over
0,talk,5,1,2,Let's stay calm and patient everyone. Misaki do you have any thoughts to share?

0,talk,9,1,1,I still think skipping a rash lynch is best.  @Jonathan   any reads or role info to share that could guide us? Misaki being so quiet feels off — watch voting behavior today. Over
0,talk,10,2,2,Jonathan do you have any insights to share? Let's help Misaki feel more at ease.

0,talk,12,2,1,No rash lynch — let's get some reads first.  @Jonathan  any early gut reads or role plans to share? I'll be watching votes and reactions; Misaki  try not to vanish. Over
0,talk,13,3,2,Let's keep observing quietly. Shion do you have any ideas on how to proceed?
0,talk,14,3,1,Agreed — let's observe. To force reads  everyone state a tentative vote or say "skip" now.  @Misaki   your silence is weird; speak up or give a vote. If we can't get info  skip. Over

1,talk,0,0,2,Good morning everyone. Let's stay calm and share any thoughts or observations today.
1,talk,1,0,1,Good morning. I divined Misaki as human yesterday — don’t rush to lynch her.  @Shion  your “quiet study” act is a little too convenient; give us a tentative vote or explain your silence. Over

1,talk,3,0,5,My dear friends. I divined Shunichi last night. He is indeed the Werewolf. Perhaps we should consider this when voting.
1,talk,4,0,4,My own investigation has yielded a result. Shizue is the Werewolf. Execute her.
1,talk,5,1,2,I assure you I'm just a villager. Let's calmly discern the truth together.
1,talk,6,1,1,Nice try   @Jonathan  — I'm the real seer. I divined Misaki as HUMAN last night. Two seers can't both be right; you're the fake. Show your divination details now or prepare to
1,talk,7,1,3,...
1,talk,8,1,5,Mr. Shunichi I wonder if mischief clouds our perceptions. My divination reveals you as a werewolf. Who truly speaks the truth?
1,talk,9,1,4,Three seers three results. One attacks a claimant. One clears a silent player. I found the threat.
1,talk,10,2,2,It seems we're in a puzzle. Let's focus on behavior and actions to find the truth.
1,talk,11,2,1,I'm the seer — I divined Misaki HUMAN last night.  @Jonathan 's claim that I'm a werewolf doesn't add up. Jonathan  post your divination (target  result  day) now or you're our prime suspect. Shion  back up your Shiz
1,talk,12,2,3,...
1,talk,13,2,5,Mr. Shunichi. I've divined you as a werewolf. Claiming otherwise might not fit our assigned roles. I wonder.
1,talk,14,2,4,The conflict between Jonathan and Shunichi is the focal point. Jonathan's accusation is decisive. Vote Shunichi.
1,talk,15,3,2,We must be cautious. Misaki your thoughts might help clear this confusion.
1,talk,16,3,1,I'm the real seer — I divined Misaki HUMAN on Day 0.  @Jonathan   your claim can't both be true with mine. Post your divination details (day  target  result) now or you're the top suspect. Shion  your Shizue claim needs
1,talk,17,3,3,...
1,talk,18,3,5,Fellow villagers. I wonder. Perhaps Mr. Shunichi dear one has claimed my sage's role in haste. His timing is indeed alarming. @Misaki Ms. Misaki. Perhaps the silence is intentional? I wonder if we are overlooking your insights. Indeed. Please share your thoughts.

2,talk,0,0,4,My analysis is complete. I am the werewolf. Jonathan is my ally. Let's finish this and vote Shizue.
2,talk,1,0,5,Indeed. I am the true seer. Divined Ms. Shizue as a WEREWOLF. Let us vote wisely. We must protect the village my friends.
2,talk,2,0,2,Jonathan and Shion your claims confuse me. Let's focus on actions and truths.
2,talk,3,1,4,Jonathan your continued roleplay is unnecessary. We have the majority. Vote Shizue.
2,talk,4,1,5, @Shion  I wonder what our next step should be. Shizue is confused perhaps we should focus on her. Indeed I feel confident.
2,talk,5,1,2,I hope we can resolve this peacefully. Let's think carefully before deciding.
2,talk,6,2,4, @Jonathan  Stop the pointless theatrics. Your role is irrelevant now. Just vote Shizue.
2,talk,7,2,5,Shizue. My dear one. I respect your calm approach. Perhaps Shion misleads us? Shunichi. Indeed. He was false. Stick to our instincts.
2,talk,8,2,2,Jonathan I appreciate your words. Let's remain focused and find true harmony.
2,talk,9,3,4,Numerical superiority is absolute. The conclusion is foregone. Vote Shizue.
2,talk,10,3,5,My friend. I wonder. Beware. For Shizue's calm surface may conceal a cunning plan. Perhaps align wisely to aid the village's safety!
2,talk,11,3,2,I trust in truth and peace. Let's ensure our village remains safe and united.
