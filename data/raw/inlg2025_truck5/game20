0,talk,2,0,2,Let's stay focused and share our thoughts to find the werewolves.
0,talk,3,0,5,I won't claim a role yet.  @Minato  you said you're a villager—why claim so quickly? Any reads or night info? Misaki  Yumi  Ryuji  what are your initial impressions? I'll wait before votin
0,talk,4,0,1,I’m looking forward to a thoughtful game. Let’s keep our reasoning sharp and avoid being swayed by assumptions.

0,talk,6,1,3,I'm Yumi! Ready for an adventure! Let's give it our all everyone
0,talk,7,1,2,It's too early for strong reads but I'm curious about Minato's early claim.
0,talk,8,1,5,I agree it's early.  @Minato  why claim villager so fast—any reason or night info? Misaki  Ryuji  Yumi  any quick impressions or suspicious behavior so far? I won't vote without clea

0,talk,11,2,2,I haven't noticed anything suspicious yet; let's keep observing and stay cautious.
0,talk,12,2,5,You were cheerful then quiet — that shift looks odd. Do you have any info or are you staying silent on purpose?  @Yumi  please share your thinking. Over
0,talk,13,3,2,I'm just observing for now Asuka. It's best to stay calm and gather more info first.
0,talk,14,3,5,Noted  Misaki. Silence can be dangerous—please speak if you notice anything.  @Minato  you claimed villager very early; any reason or night info to back that up? If not  what makes you sure? Over

1,talk,0,0,2,Let's review what happened overnight and see if we can spot any patterns or clues.
1,talk,1,0,3,I'm the Seer! I checked Ryuji last night and he's the WEREWOLF! Let's get him everyone
1,talk,2,0,1, he’s a villager. Yumi is fake—probably a madman trying to frame me.
1,talk,3,0,4,I will vote Misaki.
1,talk,4,0,5, @Yumi  You claim the seer — state when you checked Ryuji (which night)  the exact result wording  and if you checked anyone else. Without details that claim loo
1,talk,5,1,2,Yumi can you provide more details on your seer claim to clarify the situation?
1,talk,6,1,3,I checked Ryuji on night 0! He's the WEREWOLF! I'm the only Seer so let's get him everyone
1,talk,7,1,1, @Yumi  Declaring I’m a wolf so quickly could be madman play. Why trust just one CO? Let’s not rush our decision.
1,talk,8,1,4,I will vote Misaki.
1,talk,9,1,5, @Yumi  state which night you checked Ryuji  give the exact result wording  and say if you checked anyone else. Minato—why vote Misaki so fast? Ryuji—explain y
1,talk,10,2,2,Minato why target me without evidence? Let's focus on verifying Yumi's claim first.
1,talk,11,2,3,I'm telling the truth! My check on Ryuji was werewolf! We have to vote for Ryuji today! Let's go
1,talk,12,2,1,Yumi’s claim is too sudden—real Seer would be more careful. If anyone else has a result or CO now’s the time.
1,talk,13,2,4,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,14,2,5, @Yumi  If you're the seer  say which night you checked Ryuji  the exact result wording  and whether you checked anyone else. If you can't give clear details  you'
1,talk,15,3,2,Let's not rush. We need more details from Yumi to make an informed decision.
1,talk,16,3,3,Minato voting Ryuji is the right move! But why Misaki before? Let's all vote Ryuji and win
1,talk,17,3,1,Yumi avoids all questions and just pushes to rush this vote. True Seer wouldn't act like this. I'm voting Yumi.
1,talk,18,3,4,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,19,3,5, @Ryuji  You say Yumi is fake — explain concretely why and give any reads you have. Yumi  please restate which night you checked Ryuji and the exact wording of the
