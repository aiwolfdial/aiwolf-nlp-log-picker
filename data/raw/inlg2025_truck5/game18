0,talk,3,0,3,Hey hey! I'm Sakura—nice to meet you all! Ready to catch a wolf or maybe trip over my own feet? Who's with me? @Kenji  starting strong with that villager claim huh? Are you ALWAYS this honest or feeling a bit sneaky today?
0,talk,4,0,5,Hello everyone I'm George! Excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have some fun and enjoy the game!

1,talk,0,0,1,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,1,0,2,Good morning. I am the Seer. It saddens me but my vision showed that Sakura is the Werewolf.
1,talk,2,0,5,I am actually the Seer and my vision revealed that Mio is the Werewolf. We need to focus our votes correctly.
1,talk,3,0,3,I am the real Seer! Kenji is totally the werewolf! Anyone surprised? Seer party time huh? Count me in! @Mio  nice try with that seer claim! But I’m the real one. Kenji’s a werewolf! Where’s your crystal ball?
1,talk,4,0,4,Three seer COs each accuse differently but George quickly targeted Mio after her CO. That looks more suspicious to me.
1,talk,5,1,1,I will vote George.
1,talk,6,1,2,Three seers is quite a complex dance. It is hard for me to know whose rhythm to follow.
1,talk,7,1,5, Stick to my original divination. Voting Mio is crucial—my vision was clear and she's definitely the werewolf. Trust me.
1,talk,8,1,3,Wow! Everyone wants to be the seer now! Isn't it a bit crowded here or is there a disguise party going on? @Minako  you're sharp! Did you notice how fast George pointed at Mio? Doesn't that seem kinda fishy to you?
1,talk,9,1,4, @George  you switched targets fast—can you explain why you acted right after the Seer COs? It seemed a bit rushed.
1,talk,10,2,1,I will vote George.
1,talk,11,2,2,With three dancers leading it is a chaotic song. Perhaps we should vote for Minako to find harmony.
1,talk,12,2,5, My divination about Mio came before knowing she would claim Seer. I'm certain of what I saw; Mio is our threat.
1,talk,13,2,3,So many seers! Whoever has the real crystal ball wave it! Let's solve this mystery with a smile. Who do you trust? @George Hey George you're really sticking to your Mio vote! Is it your "vision" or just a hunch? We're all curious you know!
1,talk,14,2,4,If all three Seers accuse different people isn't someone trying to confuse us? Who does this chaos benefit most?
1,talk,15,3,1,I will vote George.
1,talk,16,3,2,I understand the focus on George but this disharmony is troubling. I still think voting Minako brings clarity.
1,talk,17,3,5, Trusting the Seer is key to our victory and I assure you my vision is legitimate. I divined Mio as the Werewolf. Stick with that.
1,talk,18,3,3,Whew what a show! I'm voting Kenji—he's the werewolf! Anyone else ready for a happy ending to this mystery? @Mio  you're the Seer? Explain how your vision showed me as a werewolf when I know I'm not! Plot twist!
1,talk,19,3,4,George’s certainty feels too forced and aggressive—I don’t trust it. I’m voting George today. Let’s see where this leads.

2,talk,0,0,4, @Mio  explain why the werewolf would bite out Sakura after you called her out.
2,talk,1,0,2,Skip
2,talk,2,0,1,I will vote Minako.
2,talk,3,1,4, @Mio  you claimed Sakura was a wolf but she was bite outd not vote outd. Can you explain this contradiction?
2,talk,4,1,2,What a tragic song... My vision last night showed Minako is human. The silenced dancer was right.
2,talk,5,1,1,I will vote Minako.
2,talk,6,2,4, @Kenji  your vote for me is hasty with no real reason. Defend your choice or is it just following Mio’s claims?
2,talk,7,2,2, @Minako  The wolf silenced the true seer. Let's honor Sakura's final performance and vote for Kenji.
2,talk,8,2,1,Over
2,talk,9,3,4,Mio’s seer claim fails since Sakura was bitten after being accused. My vote is for Mio. Kenji please reconsider.
2,talk,10,3,2,It seems I misread the song's tempo. Kenji's steady rhythm is our guide now. I'll follow his vote. I'm so sorry Minako.
