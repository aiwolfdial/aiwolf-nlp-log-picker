0,talk,0,0,2,Hey everyone it’s Sakura! I’m so excited I almost wore mismatched socks—anyone else get jittery before games start?

0,talk,2,0,4,Hello. I am Toshio. A new start is always a bit nerve-wracking. Let us consider this an adventure. Enjoy the game together.

1,talk,0,0,1,Good morning everyone! How are we all feeling today? Any thoughts on yesterday?
1,talk,1,0,2, I divined Minato and he is the Werewolf. Let's vote Minato out today to protect the village.
1,talk,2,0,4,Ms. Sakura claims Mr. Minato is the werewolf. I see. Minato's side is needed. Trust but verify. Interesting don't you think?
1,talk,3,0,5,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,4,0,3, I divined Toshio last night and his role is the Werewolf not Minato. Let’s focus on the real threat!
1,talk,5,1,1,This is quite a situation. Maybe both Sakura and Shizue can explain more?
1,talk,6,1,2,I’m the real Seer. I divined  @Minato  as Werewolf last night. Let’s vote him out—this protects the village!
1,talk,7,1,4,I see. We're at crossroads. Ms. Sakura claims divination names Mr. Minato a werewolf. But we have Ms. Shizue's claims. Let's consider that.
1,talk,8,1,5,Over
1,talk,9,1,3,I stand by my divination—Toshio is the Werewolf. We need to focus on the facts and protect the village. Let’s vote wisely.
1,talk,10,2,1,We need to decide who to trust. Any more insights from the rest of you?
1,talk,11,2,2,Minato showed up as Werewolf in my divination last night—I’m COing Seer. Let’s vote Minato today.
1,talk,12,2,4,Trust requires reflection. I see two Seers. Distress clouds judgment. Let's consider. Truth brings safety. Lean on Ms. Sakura's word.
1,talk,13,2,3, I assure you I am the true Seer. My divination showed Toshio as the Werewolf. We need to focus on removing the real threat today.
1,talk,14,3,1,This is tough. Should we trust Sakura and vote Minato or believe Shizue about Toshio?
1,talk,15,3,2,Only one true Seer. Minato is Werewolf by my divination. Shizue protects the wolf. My vote is for Minato.
1,talk,16,3,4,Ms.Sakura and Ms.Shizue assert claims. Tonight belongs to Ms.Midori's divination. Let's consider that. Ms.Midori thoughts?
1,talk,17,3,3, Stick with the facts. I divined Toshio as the werewolf and that's where our attention should be. Trust my vision to keep the village safe.
