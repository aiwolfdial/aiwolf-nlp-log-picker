0,talk,0,0,3,Hello. I am Yumi. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,1,0,1,Greetings dear friends. I am Servas. In the great tapestry of life let us weave a game rich in connection and spirited dialogue.
0,talk,2,0,5,Hehe! Yumi said she's a villager — could be hiding something.  @May  you're acting fishy again  why so quiet? Anyone wanna share their gut feeling or role claim? Over
0,talk,3,0,2,Hey hey! I'm Mio loud and proud villager reporting for duty! Let's keep the mood bright but find those wolves yeah? @Servas  your poetic intro made me smile! But are you weaving truth or a sneaky wolf's web? Just teasing but curious!

0,talk,7,1,5,Hehe!  @May  skipping again makes me nervous — why so quiet? Mio said she's a villager and Servas is all poetic  but I'm thinking of voting May if nobody explains. Who

0,talk,9,1,4,I am May. My interests include watching a delightful play like this one unfold. A pleasure.
0,talk,10,2,5,Hehe  let's not just vote someone off for being quiet — that's too easy!  @Mio  you said you're a villager — any reads or votes yet? I wanna hear reasons before we pick someone. Over
0,talk,11,2,4,Over
0,talk,12,3,5,Hey  @Mio  you said you're a villager real loud — what are your reads? If you can't share I'll probably vote May. Who do you think is sus? Over

1,talk,0,0,1,In the great tapestry of life. I have divined dear May and discovered they are a Werewolf. Let us vote to guard our village.
1,talk,1,0,2,Whoa big start! Servas claims Seer and says May is a werewolf? That's bold! What does everyone else think? @May  you've been super quiet but Servas dropped a huge claim on you just now! Can you tell us your side?
1,talk,2,0,5,Heehee!  @Servas  claiming seer so fast?! That sounds like a setup to me. Why accuse May right away — got any proof? Let's not rush to lynch without more info. Over
1,talk,3,0,4,My my Servas such a predictable lie. I am the true Seer and I found Sakura is the wolf.
1,talk,4,0,3,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,5,1,1,In the great tapestry of life May's claim drifts away like leaves in the wind. Dear Yumi trust my Seer's vision. Let us vote May today.
1,talk,6,1,2,Whoa we have a battle of the Seers! Servas says May is wolf but May says Sakura is wolf! Everyone's accusing! @Sakura  you don't trust either claim right now? How do you want to deal with two competing Seers? Your thoughts? 
1,talk,7,1,5,Whoa  two seers already? This is getting messy!  @Servas  you claimed so fast — where's your proof? I won't
1,talk,8,1,4,Servas dear your panic is showing. A true seer reveals with grace not with such clumsy haste.
1,talk,9,1,3,Over
1,talk,10,2,1,Ah dear villagers. If young May's claim blooms truth then I must be but a mere shadow among the trees. Trust her wisdom aloud.
1,talk,11,2,2,Wow talk about fireworks! Two Seers and both sound convincing huh? Is anyone else getting dizzy trying to keep up? @Yumi Hey Yumi you voted Sakura right away! Is it just because May called her wolf or do you have your own reasons too?
1,talk,12,2,5,Eek two seers? That smells like a trick!  @Servas  you claimed so fast and your flowery talk feels sus — are you trying to steer us? May's my friend and I don't think I'm the wolf  so let's not lynch me. I wann
1,talk,13,2,4,Let's consider the beast's play. Who seems more panicked my dears Servas or me?
1,talk,14,3,1,Ah young ones. In the great tapestry of life truth thrives as sunlight on leaves. Is Ah May's sudden Seer claim mere shadow craft to mislead? @Mio In the great tapestry of life young one we find May's web tangled. Is her fervor mere theater in this werewolf play to capture hearts?
1,talk,15,3,2,Okay folks both Seer claims are spinning tales! Sakura's holding out but Yumi is set on her vote. Can we slow down and talk? @Servas  you're really poetic today! Besides May's "divination" do you spot anything else suspicious in her behavior?
1,talk,16,3,5,Hehe I still think  @Servas  is super sus for claiming seer so fast with no proof — I'm voting them. Over

2,talk,0,0,4,I grow tired of this Seer costume. It seems our hunt was a grand success wasn't it  @Yumi ?
2,talk,1,0,3,I will vote Mio.
2,talk,2,0,2,Whoa things got intense fast! May drops her Seer act and Yumi is voting for me? Why so quick Yumi? Spill the beans! @Yumi  you're voting for me super early today! Got a reason or are you just feeling lucky? Let's hear it!
2,talk,3,1,4, @Mio  your frantic questions are adorable. But this little game is already over dear.
2,talk,4,1,3,Over
2,talk,5,1,2,Hey isn't anyone curious why May just completely gave up her Seer act? Feels like a big slip to me! Let's discuss! @May  why the sudden change? Dropping your Seer claim is kind of dramatic! What made you give up now huh?
2,talk,6,2,4,Why the change  @Mio  ? Because the curtain is falling and you dear have no allies left.
2,talk,7,2,2,Yikes May's in full villain monologue mode! Still that's awfully bold if she's not a wolf. We shouldn't give up yet! @Yumi  can you explain again why you're set on voting me? I'm just not seeing the wolf vibes from my end!
2,talk,8,3,4,Still appealing to Yumi? Oh you poor thing. The audience has already gone home.
2,talk,9,3,2,If May gave up being Seer that's pretty suspicious! I don't trust her. We might need to rethink our approach! @May  if you've nothing to lose why not defend yourself? Or will you keep playing the villain?
