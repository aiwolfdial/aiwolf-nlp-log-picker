0,talk,3,0,2,Hi everyone! I'm Rin super excited for our first day. I'm always up for adventure—maybe even catching werewolves! @Victoria  your idea sounds neat! Curious—what made you want Kenji to go first with suspicions?
0,talk,4,0,3,Wow! I'm Kenji! It's so great to meet everyone! I don't have any suspicions yet but Minako's been so quiet. Could she be strategizing? What are your tho
0,talk,5,1,5,I asked  @Kenji  first because he flipped from quiet to pointing at someone quickly — that can look like deflection. Can you explain why you suspected Minako so fast? O

1,talk,0,0,4, @Kenji  your switch from quiet to suspicion seems abrupt—are you hiding something or just nervous? Explain yourself.
1,talk,1,0,1,I am the Seer. A contract of divination was performed. Shunichi is the Werewolf.
1,talk,2,0,2,Whoa! I'll jump right in—I'm the real Seer! I divined Kenji last night and he's 100 percent Human! @Minako  interesting you claim Seer. Can you share more on how you got Shunichi as a Wolf? That's a bold move!
1,talk,3,0,5,Two seer claims can't both be true.  @Rin  you say Kenji is human — when exactly did you divine him (night 0 or night 1)? Minako  give the timing/method for your divination on Shunichi too. Don't r
1,talk,4,0,3,Wow! So Minako and Rin are both saying they're the Seer! If Shunichi's a werewolf maybe that means Minako's telling the truth! Let's hear what they hav
1,talk,5,1,4, @Minako  you claim I’m wolf but I know I’m villager—your play screams fake seer or wolf to me. Who backs you up?
1,talk,6,1,1,We have two accounts. My divination unmasked the threat Shunichi. Rin's conveniently shields Kenji.
1,talk,7,1,2,Minako coming out as Seer right after me is wild! I'll just say again: Kenji = Human divined night 0. Minako details? @Victoria  I divined Kenji during night 0—first eligible time! What are your thoughts about Minako's swift countermove?
1,talk,8,1,5,Two seer claims — risky. Rin  when exactly did you divine Kenji (night 0 or night 1)? Minako  when did you divine Shunichi and what night/method? Give exa
1,talk,9,1,3,Wow! Minako. You claim Seer on Shunichi. Wolf? That's huge! If Rin divined me as Human. it really helps her Villager claim! How confident are you about
1,talk,10,2,4,Minako claims I’m the wolf but I know I’m not so her CO is fake.  @Victoria  who do you think is the real Seer here?
1,talk,11,2,1,Consider the contract of the shadow. Does it benefit more from my charge or Rin's defense?
1,talk,12,2,2,Isn't Minako's mystical language odd? Why talk about 'contracts' instead of the classic seer approach? Seems fishy! @Kenji  you said Minako's claim is huge—are you just echoing or do you really believe her? What would you do as Seer?
1,talk,13,2,5,Two seer claims can't both be true.  @Rin  you say you divined Kenji on night 0 — give exact timing/details or I'll vote to lynch. Others: one-line reason or your vote now. Over
1,talk,14,2,3,Wow! Minako really went for it with that claim! But hey pal Rin’s divination said I'm Human! So that totally fits me as a Villager! Maybe going with a Shu
1,talk,15,3,4,I’m voting Minako—her late Seer CO and flimsy claim make her my wolf pick. Hope others see it too.
1,talk,16,3,1,Shunichi votes for me as is his nature.  @Victoria  which claim truly serves this town's contract?
1,talk,17,3,2,Minako dodged detail again! My timing's clear: I divined Kenji human night 0 first possible chance. @Victoria  again: I divined Kenji night 0 first eligible. Minako dodges the timing that's suspicious.
1,talk,18,3,5, @Minako  Give exact timing and method of your divination on Shunichi (night 0 or night 1  and when you reported it). If your story lines up I’ll back you; if not  we s
1,talk,19,3,3,Wow! If Minako's the true Seer Rin could be bluffing as wolf or possessed! Shunichi denies her claim. Let's hear more! Hey Minako! Can you clear up the t

2,talk,0,0,3,Wow! Rin if Shunichi got attacked the wolves might see him as a threat! What does that say about Minako's claim buddy?
2,talk,1,0,2,Exciting news! My night divination checked Victoria—she's the Werewolf! That backs up Shunichi's instincts. @Kenji  since Minako claimed Shunichi was Werewolf but he was attacked it casts huge doubt on her claim. Thoughts?
2,talk,2,0,5,Minako and Shunichi are gone.  @Kenji  you still haven’t given a concrete role or explanation for your earlier quick accusation — were you seer/guard/none? If you can’t clarify now I’ll vo
2,talk,3,1,3,Wow! Rin. If your divination's right. Victoria's really our Werewolf? But what if she's bluffing? We must be super sharp today.
2,talk,4,1,2,Kenji being sharp's the plan! My divinations have been open. Victoria’s behavior—why so focused on roles now? @Victoria  you’re quick to grill Kenji but deflect from my divination. Why should we trust you over my results?
2,talk,5,1,5,We're down to three.  @Kenji  you keep avoiding a clear role—explain why you accused Minako and state your role now. If you won't  I'll vote to lynch you. Others  one short line now. Ov
2,talk,6,2,3,Wow! Victoria. It's kinda strange you're focused on roles right now when Rin's divination calls you a Werewolf. I'm a Villager. What's your take?
2,talk,7,2,2,Victoria your urgency feels off! Why not answer my result directly—what's your reason for ignoring my Seer info? @Victoria  if you're Human why not challenge my Seer result clearly? Dodging my divination just digs you deeper!
2,talk,8,2,5,I’m leaning Rin's way—her night‑0 claim fits.  @Kenji  you’ve dodged clear answers; reveal your role now or I’ll vote to lynch you. Others  state your vote. Over

2,talk,10,3,2,Time’s ticking—final thoughts everyone! Voting Victoria: her behavior plus my divination seals it. Ready for adventure? @Kenji  love your trust! If you’re villager and I’m seer Victoria’s the only wolf. Cast your vote bravely!
2,talk,11,3,5,I'm voting  @Kenji . You've dodged every question — reveal your role now or accept the lynch. Over
