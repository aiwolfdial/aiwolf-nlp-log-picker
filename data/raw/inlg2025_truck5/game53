0,talk,0,0,3,Good morning everyone. Let’s keep our wits about us and stay focused right from the start.
0,talk,1,0,4,In truth. I am Victoria. Delighted to join you. Let us discover the truth about this werewolf. What are your thoughts on this?
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello. I am Sakura. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,3,0,2,Good morning. I am Ryuji. I value logical discussion and calm analysis throughout this game. @Sakura  I noticed you claimed seer early. Could you explain your reasoning for this decision?

1,talk,0,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Victoria and Victoria was a human.
1,talk,1,0,3, @Minato  you’ve been quiet. We need your opinion. Who do you suspect most right now?
1,talk,2,0,4,If I may suggest: Minato's silence intrigues me. A tactic perhaps? Who among us do we suspect of being the werewolf so far?
1,talk,3,0,5,I was just thinking about everyone's words. Is Sakura's vision the only one from the dream?
1,talk,4,0,2,Sakura's early seer claim still concerns me. I am the real Seer. Last night I checked Sakura: she is Human. @Victoria  your focus on Minato's silence is noted. I believe open analysis will help town reach clarity.
1,talk,5,1,1,I will vote Victoria.
1,talk,6,1,3, @Sakura  your vote for Victoria confuses me since you called her human. Can you explain your reasoning?
1,talk,7,1,4,Dear Sakura. Uncertainties linger with two seers present. Clarity is crucial to unveil truths.  @Ryuji  Your insights guide us.
1,talk,8,1,5,Two seers exist now. This must mean a real seer and a possessed are among us.
1,talk,9,1,2,With two seer claims logic dictates either Sakura or I am not truthful. I stand by my claim. Discussion is key. @Minato  your point is solid. Werewolves often claim seer. Let's deduce who is truly trustworthy together.
1,talk,10,2,1,Over
1,talk,11,2,3, @Sakura  you said Victoria is human but still voted her. Why? That feels off. Can you clarify your logic?
1,talk,12,2,4,If I may suggest. Let us deliberate on the credibility of Sakura and Ryuji. In truth. Our choice impacts us deeply.
1,talk,13,2,5,Let us think from another view. What is the goal of the shadow wolf today?
1,talk,14,2,2,The contradiction between Sakura's words and vote is concerning. Consistency in behavior is important when revealing roles. @George  your questioning of Sakura's voting logic is appropriate. Her actions lack internal consistency.
1,talk,15,3,3,Sakura’s vote for Victoria does not add up. I will vote Sakura. Town should not ignore clear contradictions.
1,talk,16,3,4,Two seer claims complicate matters. Let's focus on contradictions and consistency. Sakura's vote for me seems illogical. Mr. Minato. Think about y
1,talk,17,3,5,George I understand your view but removing a possessed could be a trap for us. Let us reconsider this path.
1,talk,18,3,2,Given Sakura's voting and seer claim contradiction voting her safeguards town logic. Consistency is essential to trust. @Minato  your caution on Possessed is rational but Sakura's errors threaten town integrity and can't be ignored.

2,talk,0,0,3, @Minato  it’s down to us now. Honestly who do you think is most likely the werewolf after yesterday’s vote out?
2,talk,1,0,4,Ryuji's lost. Our brave seer is missed. Suspecting George. Minato your silence breeds suspicion. Dear Minato. Speak to find truth.
2,talk,2,0,5,The true seer Ryuji said Sakura was human. Why did George lead the vote against her? That feels wrong.
2,talk,3,1,3, @Minato  you questioned me after Sakura went out—can you state clearly now who you plan to vote and why?
2,talk,4,1,4,If I may suggest. Ryuji’s insights have significant value. Mr. George has made some dubious votes. Minato should be divined to clarify his quiet role
2,talk,5,1,5,George I must vote for you. You went against our seer's insight about Sakura. That is my reason.
2,talk,6,2,3, @Victoria  you cast suspicion on both of us but never pick a side. Isn’t that just covering for yourself?
2,talk,7,2,4,We've lost our true seer. Ryuji's reading of Sakura adds weight. Minato. May I ask your rationale for George's current vote? George. I trust Ryuji's s
2,talk,8,2,5, @George  The truth we found yesterday points only to you. It's a sad but logical conclusion.
2,talk,9,3,3,Victoria you dodge every clear answer and avoid committing I suspect you’re the werewolf I’m voting for you
2,talk,10,3,4,Minato. George. If I may suggest. We should heed Ryuji's divination. Ryuji ought to divine George. His actions contradict him.
2,talk,11,3,5,George's doubt is a shadow meant to confuse us. The seer's truth points to his actions.
