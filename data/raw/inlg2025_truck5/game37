0,talk,0,0,1,I don't have strong reads and don't want to rush a wrong vote. If no one claims a role  I'd prefer to skip lynching today.  @Sakura  what do you think? Over
0,talk,1,0,3,I understand your caution Daisuke. Let's listen to what others think before deciding.

0,talk,3,0,4,Hello everyone I'm Sakura! Excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have fun and good luck to everyone!
0,talk,4,0,2,Hello. I am Jonathan. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,1,Jonathan claimed seer but hasn't given any result. That's worrying.  @Jonathan  what did you check? If you can't prove it  I don't want to rush a lynch — I'd rather skip today. Over
0,talk,6,1,3,Jonathan if you're the seer sharing your check could help guide us.

0,talk,10,2,1,I... I'm uneasy about Jonathan claiming seer but giving no result. I don't want to rush a lynch now  but Sakura's one-word reply felt strange and quiet.  @Sakura  could you say your role or why you answered like that? If you won't  I think we should at least keep an eye on her. Over
0,talk,11,2,3,Sakura if you're comfortable sharing more could help build trust among us.
0,talk,12,2,5,A claim without data is like a tree without roots. It is hard to trust  @Jonathan .
0,talk,13,3,1,I don't like Jonathan's silent seer claim. If you're really the seer you should give at least one result — otherwise it's a risky claim. Sorry  but I'm le @Jonathan  please show your check or we'll have to consider you a fake. Over
0,talk,14,3,3,Jonathan sharing your result might clear up the confusion and help us move forward.
0,talk,15,3,5,A story without a beginning is just scattered words.  @Jonathan  please share your beginning.

1,talk,0,0,4, I am the seer and divined last night my result showed that George is the werewolf.
1,talk,1,0,3,I assure you Sakura's claim is false. I'm just a villager. Let's discuss this calmly.
1,talk,2,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Sakura and Sakura was a human.
1,talk,3,0,1,Two seer claims and they don't match.  @Jonathan  you said you divined Sakura as human — when exactly did you check and why should we trust it over Sakura's claim? If you can't clarify  I don't think I can t
1,talk,4,0,5,Two conflicting dreams. Jonathan sees Sakura as human yet Sakura sees George as a nightmare.
1,talk,5,1,4, We must act on reliable information. My divination is accurate and George is the werewolf. Trust in my vision for our safety.
1,talk,6,1,3,I'm innocent and Jonathan's claim supports me. We must find the true werewolf together.
1,talk,7,1,2,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,8,1,1,Two seer claims clash and it's confusing.  @Jonathan  please say exactly when you divined Sakura and the precise result format. I can't decide who to trust without details — if you won't clarify I'll have t
1,talk,9,1,5,Jonathan's vision suggests Sakura is a Paradox. Voting for a Paradox is not the path to truth.
1,talk,10,2,4, I am confident in my role and the information I provided. George being the werewolf is crucial for our village's survival. Trust my divination.
1,talk,11,2,3,Daisuke we need clarity from Jonathan to make an informed decision. Let's sort this calmly.

1,talk,13,2,1,I'm still uneasy with the two seer claims. Sakura's sudden claim and short replies feel off to me. I'm leaning to vote Sakura unless someone convinces @Sakura  please explain your check and timing. Over
1,talk,14,2,5,If Jonathan is true then Sakura is a Paradox. What is the Weaver's true target today?
1,talk,15,3,4,  Trust my revelation as the true seer. I wouldn't claim if I weren't certain. I divined George as the werewolf. Listen to the truth.
1,talk,16,3,3,Sakura if you truly divined me explain why your claim differs from Jonathan's.
1,talk,17,3,1,I'm sorry  I'm still uneasy about the conflicting seer claims and Sakura hasn't explained. I don't want to risk doing nothing  so I'll vote  @Sakura . Over

2,talk,0,0,4,Daisuke please vote for Minato today. Based on the actions and results after two days Minato is the most suspicious and likely the Werewolf.
2,talk,1,0,5,I am the Weaver of Nightmares. Sakura is the Paradox. Our victory is here. We vote for Daisuke.
2,talk,2,0,1,I'm still really nervous.  @Sakura  please say exactly when you divined and the precise result — I need proof. If you can't  I'll have to vote you. Minato  do you have any read? Over
2,talk,3,1,4,Daisuke please consider voting Minato. Given the elimination patterns and remaining players he's likely the Werewolf. We need to stick together as
2,talk,4,1,5,My read has not changed Daisuke. Sakura is the Paradox. Her final words are a strange dream.
2,talk,5,1,1,I... I still can't trust the two seer claims.  @Sakura  please give the exact timing and format of your divination (like "Night1: George — werewolf"). If you don't  I'm going to have to vote for you. Over
2,talk,6,2,4,Daisuke please focus on Minato's responses. They have been evasive since the start and this aligns them more with a Werewolf strategy to sow confusio
2,talk,7,2,5,Daisuke the dream is over. We are two you are one. The logic of numbers dictates the end.
2,talk,8,2,1,I'm really scared of making the wrong choice... Minato has been too quiet and I can't trust the seer claims now. I'm sorry  but I'll vote  @Minato . Over
2,talk,9,3,4, Thank you Daisuke. We need to remain vigilant and ensure our village is secure from threats. Let's hope we've made the right choice today.
2,talk,10,3,5,The real Seer's final vision saw Sakura as human. She is the Paradox. It is two versus one now.
2,talk,11,3,1,I'm really nervous and don't know who to trust.  @Minato  could you tell us your role or any check? If you don't  I think I'll have to keep my vote on you. Over
