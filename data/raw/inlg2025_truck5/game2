0,talk,0,0,1,I am Misaki. I will do my best to contribute to the village discussion. Please let’s have a calm and rational game.
0,talk,1,0,2,Let me observe the game’s first moves closely.  @May  how do you approach the tension at the start?
0,talk,2,0,4,I keep it light but probing — ask simple questions  watch timing and contradictions  and don’t rush roleclaims. I’ll press if someone slips.  @Toshio   what’s your read so far?
0,talk,3,0,5,Hi everyone. I'm Daisuke. Let's work together to find the werewolves. Any thoughts?

0,talk,10,2,4,You’re being evasive   @Daisuke  — who would you vote for today? If you won’t say  your silence looks suspicious and I’m leaning toward voting you. Anyone disagree? Over
0,talk,11,2,5,I understand May. I’ll need more info before deciding. Maybe Misaki or Toshio first?
0,talk,12,3,4,Nice dodge   @Daisuke . If you suspect Misaki or Toshio  pick one and tell us why now — no explanation and I’m voting you. Over
0,talk,13,3,5,Okay May. I’ll say Misaki seems quiet. I want to hear more from them.

1,talk,0,0,3, It's a bit early but noting your stance Daisuke. Let's hear Misaki's input; stay engaged everyone.
1,talk,1,0,4, @Misaki  you were called out as quiet — what's your read and who would you vote for? If you stay silent I'm leaning to vote Daisuke for dodging. Quick reads from ot
1,talk,2,0,2,@Daisuke you dodge too much. Still I want to hear from  @Misaki  before deciding. Silence is risky at this stage.
1,talk,3,0,5,Let's hear from Misaki. We need more input to make informed decisions today.
1,talk,4,0,1,I tend to observe quietly but I understand the concern. Based on yesterday May appears quite forceful in her approach. @May  your assertive questioning stands out. Can you clarify what you hope to achieve with this pressure?
1,talk,5,1,3, Interesting point Misaki. May's assertiveness could mask deeper intentions. Let's discuss more on this.
1,talk,6,1,4,I’m not bullying — I probe to force concrete reads because silence and dodges help wolves. You observing folks  give a short read.  @Daisuke  you said they’re quiet — what specific behavior makes you suspect them beyond being silent? If it’s just that  it’s weak. Over
1,talk,7,1,2, @May  your push feels forceful sudden pressure often masks a wolf’s intent I’d watch your approach carefully
1,talk,8,1,5,May I just found Misaki's quietness unusual. Listening more now helps my read.
1,talk,9,1,1,I'm focused on actions not tone. Anyone notice inconsistencies? Consistency matters not just assertiveness. @May  your approach is clear. I don't see contradictions yet—assertiveness alone isn't enough for suspicion.
1,talk,10,2,3, Thank you Misaki for focusing on consistency. It's crucial indeed. May's forceful approach does raise some flags though. Should evaluate further.
1,talk,11,2,4,We need concrete moves.  @Daisuke  you accused Misaki of being quiet—what behavior made you suspicious besides silence? If you can’t answer now I’ll vote you. Others  quick reads or vot
1,talk,12,2,2,May’s focus on Daisuke is strong but I’m more wary of Takumi who keeps slipping under the radar. Thoughts?
1,talk,13,2,5,May it's mainly the silence. I'll focus on actions and consistency more now.
1,talk,14,2,1,A calm approach is best. Watching for overreactions or control is wise. Let's consider everyone's motivations carefully. @Toshio  your point about Takumi staying low is interesting. What concerns you most about his actions?
1,talk,15,3,3,Everyone should consider voting for May; based on her divination results she mistakenly identified Toshio as a werewolf. Her aggressive stance may
1,talk,16,3,4, @Daisuke  still dodging—give specifics or I’ll vote you. Everyone else  quick reads or vote declarations now. Over
1,talk,17,3,2,Takumi’s divination claim feels evasive. I’ll vote Takumi today. Clarity matters more than distracting maneuvers.
1,talk,18,3,5,Takumi's claim is surprising. I'm unsure now. I'll decide after hearing more.
1,talk,19,3,1,Takumi's sudden seer claim and accusation are worth considering calmly. Abrupt reveals often carry risk if unfounded. @Toshio  you noted concern about Takumi. How do you interpret his timing and claim? Do you think it is genuine?

2,talk,0,0,2,Takumi’s late Seer claim looks desperate under pressure. Should we trust that result without deeper digging?
2,talk,1,0,5,With May gone we need to reevaluate. Takumi got attacked any thoughts everyone?
2,talk,2,0,1,Takumi being attacked could suggest their Seer claim was genuine but we shouldn't dismiss the odd timing so quickly.
2,talk,3,1,2, @Daisuke  your hesitation stands out. Wolves often hide in indecision. Do you have a clear suspect today?
2,talk,4,1,5,I'm unsure Toshio. Misaki’s calm approach seems off but I need more info.
2,talk,5,1,1,Let's reassess yesterday's logic. Sudden claims and actions can mask intentions. Caution is warranted as we proceed. @Toshio  I notice you're persistent in questioning others but what are your thoughts on Daisuke's repeated hesitation?
2,talk,6,2,2, @Misaki  Daisuke avoids naming suspects all game. Wolves love ambiguity. Shouldn’t a villager be firmer by now?
2,talk,7,2,5,I understand Toshio. I’ll focus on Misaki today. Her calmness feels strategic.
2,talk,8,2,1,We should be careful not to overlook Daisuke shifting suspicions quickly. Consistency in approach is important. @Daisuke Your tendency to change targets often without clear basis makes reasoning difficult. Why not commit to your reads?
2,talk,9,3,2,Takumi’s rushed claim can't be checked and Daisuke keeps dodging firm reads. My vote is for  @Daisuke  as wolf.
2,talk,10,3,5,I’m trying Misaki. I’ll focus more on consistency. Your calmness still worries me.
2,talk,11,3,1,Takumi's late Seer claim and immediate attack are curious. We should not trust the divination without more analysis. @Toshio I see your suspicion of Daisuke. Do you think his indecision is more suspicious than Takumi's sudden Seer claim?
