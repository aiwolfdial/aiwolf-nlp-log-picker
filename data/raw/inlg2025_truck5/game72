1,talk,1,0,2, Jonathan is human based on my divination. Let's focus on finding the werewolf among the others.
1,talk,2,0,3,Mizuki is human based on my vision. Let's focus our efforts elsewhere.
1,talk,3,0,4, Mizuki or Victoria?
1,talk,4,0,5,Ah. Mizuki and Victoria both wearing the Seer's mantle is akin to two protagonists in a suspense novel. We must await their visions to unveil the true s
1,talk,5,1,1,...
1,talk,6,1,2,Vote for Jonathan today. I believe he might be manipulating his role given the conclusions from our divinations.
1,talk,7,1,3,Mizuki and I are both claiming Seer. Let's analyze behavior before deciding.
1,talk,8,1,4, @Mizuki  your divination says Jonathan is human so why push to vote him out? Did you notice something odd?
1,talk,9,1,5,Ah. Mizuki's call to vote for me defies her divination. Curious.  @Daisuke  You've remained silent. What are your thoughts on Mizuki's and Victoria's seer claims?
1,talk,10,2,1,...
1,talk,11,2,2, Jonathan's claim doesn't match with my findings; it seems strategically misleading. It's crucial we vote him to protect the village.
1,talk,12,2,3,We need more evidence before making a hasty decision. Let's gather more insights.
1,talk,13,2,4,I can't trust Mizuki’s logic—she divined Jonathan as human but still wants him voted out. That's too suspicious for me.
1,talk,14,2,5,Ms. Mizuki's choice to cast her vote upon me strikes a peculiar chord in the symphony of truth. Shall we observe her intent?
1,talk,15,3,1,...
1,talk,16,3,2, Jonathan divining Victoria as a Werewolf contradicts my findings. I urge we act on this discrepancy and vote Jonathan out for the village's safety.
1,talk,17,3,3,Conflicting claims complicate things. Daisuke your insights could help clarify.
1,talk,18,3,4,I’m voting for Mizuki—her logic doesn’t fit a villager.
1,talk,19,3,5,If Mizuki is indeed the true Seer. Perhaps her human divination of me isn't the whole story. I suggest she divine Daisuke to clarify. Ms. Victoria. Con

2,talk,0,0,4, @Daisuke  you’ve been really quiet. Can you tell us clearly who you suspect and why before we vote?
2,talk,1,0,5,I find myself pondering if Daisuke in this labyrinth of enigmas holds the threads that may unravel these curious circumstances.
2,talk,2,0,1,...
2,talk,3,1,4, @Daisuke  you haven’t explained your vote or who you trust. Why are you avoiding making a choice?
2,talk,4,1,5,Since Victoria's gone Kenji is my best guess. This labyrinth needs unwinding and Kenji's story feels one thread short. Mr. Kenji. With Victoria out c

2,talk,6,2,4, @Daisuke  your silence is dangerous for us. If you’re really village speak up—who do you actually suspect right now?
2,talk,7,2,5,Kenji. Your defense blooms with confidence. Without Victoria and Mizuki's Seer claims. Daisuke's silence is a shadow over us.
2,talk,8,2,1,...
2,talk,9,3,4, @Jonathan  I’m voting Daisuke. Silence helps the wolf most. If I’m wrong I accept it but we need active villagers to win.
2,talk,10,3,5,Mizuki's elimination. Like a book's missing page. Daisuke's stillness. Shadows unfitting. But Kenji? He illuminates. Like a lighthouse beam.
