0,talk,0,0,4,Hi everyone — I'm May  24. Quick round: name  age  and one gut read. I'll go first: May  24  no strong reads yet.  @George   how about you?
0,talk,1,0,2,Hello everyone I'm Minako! Excited to play and strategize with you all in Werewolf. Let's have fun and find those werewolves!
0,talk,2,0,5,Hello everyone. I am Shunichi and it's a pleasure to meet you. No Sherlock-level suspicions yet but let's unmask the werewolf together!
0,talk,3,0,3,I trust observation over impulse. Watching everyone closely reveals more truth than loud claims. Let’s see who acts sincere.
0,talk,4,0,1,Hi everyone I'm George 65. No strong gut reads yet but let's keep an eye on things.
0,talk,5,1,4,I’m leaning suspicious of  @George  — staying too neutral this early feels odd. George  who would you vote for if we did it now? Everyone else  one-line gut read  please. Over

0,talk,9,1,1,May if I had to choose now I'd lean towards silence. Let's see how it unfolds.
0,talk,10,2,4, @George  — being so neutral this early looks off. Give one concrete reason we should trust you. If you can't  I'll vote for you at the first lynch. Others: quick gu
0,talk,11,2,1,May my calm approach is my strength. Let's focus on gathering more information first.
0,talk,12,3,4, @George  Nice poker face  but that's not an answer. Who would you vote for right now? If you won't say  I'll vote for you. Others  quick one-line reads.
0,talk,13,3,1,May honestly I'd consider Minako; her excitement seems a bit too eager to me.

1,talk,0,0,3, @Minako  @Shunichi you’ve been quiet. I want concrete reads from both of you. Who seems suspicious right now?
1,talk,1,0,5,Well I'd wager May's directness shines like a chessmaster unveiling their endgame. It certainly highlights the real schemers wouldn't you agree?
1,talk,2,0,1,Interesting point Shunichi. May's assertiveness could either lead us or mislead us.
1,talk,3,0,4, @George  — you flipped to Minako pretty fast after staying neutral. What's your real read and who will you vote for now? If you dodge I'll go with you. Others — qui
1,talk,4,0,2, I divined Shunichi last night and the result came back as Werewolf. We should focus on this information.
1,talk,5,1,3, @Shunichi  Minako called you Werewolf. Are you the Seer or something else? Please CO so we can judge.
1,talk,6,1,5,Wow Minako! That's a bold claim. I'm a villager. Anyone else want to share about Minako?  @May  Minako claims I'm a werewolf. Your take?
1,talk,7,1,1,Minako's claim is strong but we need more evidence. Shunichi any defense?
1,talk,8,1,4, @Minako  What made you call Shunichi a werewolf? Give concrete behavior or timing. Shunichi — what's your defense? I won't vote until I hear both. Over
1,talk,9,1,2, I'm the Seer and my ability is not affected by personal judgment. Diving into the night visions gives me concrete evidence. Shunichi is a Werewolf.
1,talk,10,2,3,@May  @George  we need a clear stance now. Do you trust Minako’s Seer claim or suspect she’s faking? Choose sides.
1,talk,11,2,5,Well Minako’s claim is quite the plot twist. I must counter with my own role. I'm indeed a Villager. Trusting this could be tricky.
1,talk,12,2,1,I lean towards trusting Minako's Seer claim. Shunichi's defense feels uncertain.
1,talk,13,2,4, @Minako  What exactly made you call Shunichi a werewolf? Point to specific lines or timing. If you can't back it up  I'll be more suspicious of you. Others — quick
1,talk,14,2,2,  My role as the Seer lets me divine others' true nature. Last night's divine result showed Shunichi as the Werewolf. No guesswork just facts.
1,talk,15,3,3,I’m voting @Shunichi based on  @Minako ’s Seer claim. No counter means we trust her—let’s not let the wolf slip by today.
1,talk,16,3,5,I suspect Minako might lead us astray with her tall tales. If she's the werewolf our cozy village could meet its demise. Let's be vigilant! @Toshio How confident am I in trusting Minako? Well if she's pulling a fast one on us we're in a world of trouble aren't we?
1,talk,17,3,1,Shunichi if Minako's wrong we'll know soon. But her Seer claim is compelling now.
1,talk,18,3,4, @Minako  Please point to the exact lines or timing that made you call Shunichi a werewolf — concrete reasons only. Others: one-line reads and tentative votes.
1,talk,19,3,2,  My ability as the Seer let me divine Shunichi and the result clearly marked him as the Werewolf. That's the evidence I rely on.
