0,talk,1,0,5,Sakura skipped — that's not helpful.  @Mizuki   if you're the seer  tell us your divination now. If you won't  I'll have to push to vote Daisuke; someone needs to take charge. Over
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm Rin excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have fun and unravel mysteries together!

0,talk,4,0,2,Hello. I am Mizuki. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,3,Hi everyone I'm Sakura! I love going on adventures and finding treasure! And big explosions! Hehe
0,talk,6,1,5, @Mizuki  you said you're the seer — tell us who you divined and the result right now  and when you checked. If you won't  I'll push to vote Daisuke today; I don't trus

1,talk,0,0,4,Mizuki-chan I suppose it's best if you share your divination results first. Maybe it'll help clear doubts from Takumi-kun.
1,talk,1,0,5,I agree with Daisuke —  @Mizuki  please show your divination result (who you checked and when). We need proof now or I'll keep pushing to vote Daisuke. Over
1,talk,2,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Takumi and Takumi was a human.
1,talk,3,0,3,Hold on! Sakura's the REAL Seer! I peeked at Takumi and he was a friend! Mizuki is a sneaky Possessed
1,talk,4,0,1, I divined Takumi as well and he is actually a Werewolf. We need to discuss this discrepancy carefully.
1,talk,5,1,4,I suppose we should keep an eye on Takumi for now.  @Sakura . Oh. A fellow adventurer! Did you divine Takumi first or later?
1,talk,6,1,5,This is messy. Two people say I'm human and one says I'm a werewolf — they can't all be right.  @Rin  when did you check Takumi and what exactly did you see? Sakura  did you check before or after Mizuki? Whoever's lying is the fake seer or a werewolf. Over
1,talk,7,1,2,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,8,1,3,Three Seers means we have a real one a Possessed and a Wolf! Rin's a big fibber so she's the Wolf!
1,talk,9,1,1, I need to clarify: I am not the Seer. I initially claimed to be to gather more data but now it’s clear Mizuki or Sakura might be aligned with the Werewolf t
1,talk,10,2,4,I suppose… one of the seers might be genuine. Mizuki-chan and Sakura-chan aren't all truthful. Let's vote carefully. Maybe?
1,talk,11,2,5, @Sakura  when did you check Takumi — before or after Mizuki? Explain quickly or I won't believe your claim. I won't be fooled by conflicting seers. Over
1,talk,12,2,2,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,13,2,3,No way! Rin is the wolfie fibber! Mizuki is the Possessed! Let's all make Rin go BOOM! today! Yay
1,talk,14,2,1,Everyone please consider voting for Takumi. The conflicting seer reports suggest he is most likely to be the Werewolf.
1,talk,15,3,4, @Takumi  D-Do you think it helps if the real Seer checks someone like me or Rin who hasn't claimed yet? It might clear things up.
1,talk,16,3,5, @Rin  when did you check Takumi and what exactly did you see? We need the night and precise wording. I agree with Daisuke — don't lynch without clear proof. If

1,talk,19,3,1, Voting Takumi is logical given the conflicting divination results. It's safer to eliminate him to confirm the real Seer.
