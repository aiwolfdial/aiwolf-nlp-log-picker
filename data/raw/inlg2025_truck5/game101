0,talk,1,0,5,Silence from Shunichi is suspicious.  @Shunichi   speak up — what's your read and will you claim a role? Everyone else  state your reads and tentative vote. Over
0,talk,2,0,3,Skip
0,talk,3,0,4,Shunichi I think it's important for everyone to share thoughts. Any clues so far?
0,talk,4,0,1,Hello. I am Asuka. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,2,Over
0,talk,6,1,5,Silence from you still looks odd.  @Shunichi  do you have a role or a read to share? Asuka claimed villager already — if no one gives a better reason  I'm leaning to vote Shunichi. Speak now or I'll vote
0,talk,7,1,3,I am Shion. Let's begin.
0,talk,8,1,4,Shunichi we're all sharing our thoughts. Do you have anything to add?
0,talk,9,1,1,Over
0,talk,10,2,5, @Shunichi  you still haven't given a read or role—speak up now or I'll vote you. Everyone else  state your vote. I vote Shunichi. Over
0,talk,11,2,3,Over
0,talk,12,2,4,I'll keep an open mind for now. Let's see if Shunichi speaks up.
0,talk,13,3,5,Silence from  @Shunichi  still looks bad. I’ll keep my vote on him — anyone with a reason not to  speak now. Over
0,talk,14,3,4,Maybe Shunichi is just shy. Let's give him a chance to speak.

1,talk,1,0,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,2,0,4,Asuka what made you suspicious of Toshio? Let's hear more thoughts from everyone.
1,talk,3,0,5, @Asuka  Why are you voting me? I already revealed my divination — Shunichi was HUMAN. Voting the revealed seer after that is extremely suspicious. Explain no
1,talk,4,0,3,Toshio's analysis is flawed. I am the Seer. My divination on Shunichi was werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,2,...
1,talk,6,1,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,7,1,4,Wow conflicting claims! Toshio and Shion can you share more about your reads?
1,talk,8,1,5,I divined Shunichi HUMAN last night — I'm the seer. Asuka voting me despite that looks like wolf play —  @Asuka  explain or I'll vote you. Others  share reads and votes. My vote: Asuka. Over
1,talk,9,1,3,The claims are contradictory. A logical impasse. Therefore executing a gray agent like Kenji is optimal.
1,talk,10,2,2,...
1,talk,11,2,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,12,2,4,I'm just a villager trying to help. Can we focus on Toshio and Shion's claims?
1,talk,13,2,5,I already revealed I'm the seer — I divined Shunichi HUMAN. Asuka voting me after that looks like wolf play.  @Asuka  explain your reason now or I'll vote you. Kenji  Shion — share your reads and votes. My vote: Asuka. Over
1,talk,14,2,3,Resolving the CO is inefficient. Executing the unconfirmed Kenji is the only logical path.
1,talk,15,3,2,...
1,talk,16,3,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,17,3,4,I still think we should focus on resolving the seer claims first. Any suggestions?
1,talk,18,3,5,Final call before voting closes.  @Asuka  explain why you're voting me — you have no reason yet. If no good answer  I'll cast my vote for you. Kenji  Shion  what's your final vote? My vote: Asuka. Ove
