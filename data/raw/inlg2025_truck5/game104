0,talk,0,0,4,I’ll be paying close attention to small details this game; that’s where the truth hides.
0,talk,1,0,3,It's wise to notice details Shion. Let's all stay observant and keep our minds clear.

0,talk,3,0,5,Hello everyone I'm Victoria thrilled to join you all for a game of Werewolf! Let's have some fun figuring out who's who!
0,talk,4,0,1,Um hello. My name is Minato. I hope we can get along. I'm a little nervous but I’ll try my best to help. @Victoria  you seem excited. Um do you play this game often? I’m curious because you sound confident.

1,talk,0,0,2,Whoever is the Seer please speak up! We're counting on you to lead the way
1,talk,1,0,3,If the Seer feels safe revealing it might help us make informed decisions today.
1,talk,2,0,1,Um everyone... I think I should say something now. I'm the Seer. Last night I checked Minako. @Minako  I'm a bit nervous but I want to let you know—I divined you as Human. I hope that's okay to share now.
1,talk,3,0,5, Thank you Minato for trusting us with your role and findings. Knowing Minako is human helps narrow down suspects.
1,talk,4,0,4,Isn’t it risky to trust Minato’s Seer claim so quickly? We should look closer at Victoria or Yumi today.
1,talk,5,1,2,Let's vote on one of the greys today! My adventurer's gut feels a bit iffy about Shion's comment
1,talk,6,1,3,Minato thank you for sharing. Let's discuss who might be suspicious among the rest.
1,talk,7,1,1,I feel a bit unsure but I want to help us find clues gently. Who do you all think seems a bit unusual so far? @Shion  I noticed you suggested looking at Victoria or Yumi. Could you share why you feel that way? I'm curious.
1,talk,8,1,5,I think we should consider voting for Yumi today. Her eagerness to call for a vote without much discussion raises a red flag.
1,talk,9,1,4, @Victoria  you've been quick to push votes today. That kind of urgency could mean you're hiding something. Thoughts?
1,talk,10,2,2,Minato's our Seer! That means the Wolf and Possessed must be Shion and Victoria! Simple as that
1,talk,11,2,3,Let's not rush. We should carefully examine each action before deciding on a vote.
1,talk,12,2,1,I wonder if everyone's leaning toward Victoria or Shion now? I'm honestly having trouble deciding... @Yumi  you seem certain about Victoria and Shion. Could you explain what makes you feel so sure? I just want to understand.
1,talk,13,2,5, It's crucial to consider Yumi pushed to vote without complete information and quickly accused Shion and me when pressured.
1,talk,14,2,4,Victoria you’re directing things a bit too strongly. Fast votes benefit wolves. Why rush when we haven’t heard enough?
1,talk,15,3,2, @Shion  Let's think like the wolf! Their goal is to make us doubt our Seer and you did that
1,talk,16,3,3,Let's focus on gathering more insights before we make any hasty decisions today.
1,talk,17,3,1,It's hard for me to tell who is suspicious yet. I want to listen more and see if anyone's words don't match their actions. @Victoria  um is there a reason you feel so strongly about voting Yumi? I'd like to understand your thinking if that's okay.
1,talk,18,3,5,I encourage everyone to vote for Yumi today. Her haste and quick accusations point to a werewolf trying to sow discord and confusion.
1,talk,19,3,4,Yumi’s fast accusations feel reckless and suspicious. I’m voting Yumi. If I’m wrong I’ll look at Victoria next.

2,talk,0,0,4, @Minako  Victoria pushed hard to direct votes both days. Wolves usually lead from the front. Who benefits most?
2,talk,1,0,3,With Minato gone we must be extra careful. Shion Victoria let's hear your thoughts.
2,talk,2,0,5,I admit I'm the Possessed. Shion as the Werewolf we should vote for Minako today. Minato confirmed her human making her our biggest hurdle to winning.
2,talk,3,1,4, @Minako  Victoria’s Possessed CO feels like a desperate wolf play. Wolves love last-minute dramatics—logic says vote her.
2,talk,4,1,3,Victoria's claim feels suspicious to me. I'm inclined to trust Shion's logic here.
2,talk,5,1,5, Shion stick to our goal. You know Minako being human is a threat. Let's secure our win by voting her out.
2,talk,6,2,4, @Minako  since you’re confirmed human it’s logical to vote you out or else wolves win. I’m voting for you.
2,talk,7,2,3,Shion consider carefully. Voting me out only aids the wolves. Victoria's claim is false.
2,talk,8,2,5, Minako with Minato gone your human status becomes a liability. Shion's vote solidifies our path.
2,talk,9,3,4,Even if Victoria is lying choosing Minako is safer. I’ll vote Minako—letting a checked survive feels too risky now.
2,talk,10,3,3,Shion think critically. Eliminating a confirmed human only benefits Victoria if she's lying.
2,talk,11,3,5, Shion we must vote together. Our success depends on removing the human obstacle. Vote for Minako today.
