0,talk,0,0,4,Ah greetings everyone. I am Shion. Isn't that interesting? This game of deduction beckons us into its intricate web. Shall we begin?

0,talk,2,0,2,Good evening everyone. May we all approach this night with care and open minds insightful words shine brightest in the dark.
0,talk,3,0,5,I'm Takumi.  @Midori  why skip? If you're the seer  show your result now — silence looks suspicious. I'll vote for you if there's no good reason. Anyone disagree  speak up. Ove
0,talk,4,0,3,Hi everyone! I'm Sakura and I'm a Villager! Hehe let's have some fun today and figure out the baddies together! @Midori Hey Midori! Skipping makes me super curious! Did you just miss the intro or hiding something? Haha fess up!

0,talk,6,1,1,My sincerest apologies. I am Midori. I find tranquility in a simple cup of tea. It is a pleasure to be here.

0,talk,8,1,5,I'm not convinced by Sakura's "villager" claim.  @Midori  you skipped earlier — if you're the seer  show your result now. If you don't  I'm voting you. Over

0,talk,11,2,5,I don't buy Sakura's "villager" claim.  @Sakura   why so cheerful with no proof? If you can't give a reason  I'm voting you. Who's with me? Over
0,talk,12,3,5,I'm voting Sakura. If nobody speaks up to defend her  she's getting lynched. Anyone got a real reason to save her? Over

1,talk,0,0,1,I am the Seer. My findings from last night show Takumi is Human.
1,talk,1,0,3,Wow exciting start! Midori you say Takumi is human? That's a big claim! I love solving mysteries hehe! @Midori  you really saw Takumi as human? Why did you check him first? Curious minds want to know!
1,talk,2,0,4,Midori I'm glad you claimed seer. Have you considered divining Sakura tonight? It'll clear doubts and guide us forward won't it?
1,talk,3,0,5,Thanks  @Midori  for checking me. If you're really the seer  why check me first — that looks like a play to gain trust. Prove it: check someone else tonight and tell us tomo
1,talk,4,0,2,If another seer exists I urge you to come forward now—it’s vital we clarify claims before votes begin.
1,talk,5,1,1,Takumi's zeal prompted my discernment. He is human. The foe is among Sakura Servas or Shion.
1,talk,6,1,3,Hehe! Feels like everyone's staring at me again! But I just wanna find the werewolf and have fun doing it! @Shion Hey Shion! If Midori checks me tonight and I turn out human who do you think you'll vote for next?
1,talk,7,1,4,Midori targeting Sakura tonight might balance trust. If you think about it...  @Sakura  if Midori confirms you as human we focus on Servas? His stance seems distant. Isn't that interesting?
1,talk,8,1,5,Midori  big claim — prove it. If you’re really the seer  check  @Servas  tonight and tell us tomorrow. Servas has been too distant and that looks suspicious to me. Don’t just say it — act. Over
1,talk,9,1,2, @Midori  please check Sakura tonight. If Sakura is cleared the wolves are likely among Takumi or Shion.
1,talk,10,2,1,Our path is clear. We must choose our exile from among Sakura Servas and Shion.
1,talk,11,2,3,Heehee it's lively! If you all want Midori to check me let's do it! Can't wait for tomorrow's reveal! @Takumi Hey Takumi! You want Midori to check Servas but everyone wants me cleared. Hiding something or just bold?
1,talk,12,2,4,If Midori is indeed the true seer and chooses to divine Sakura tonight isn't that interesting? We'll have clearer insights tomorrow won't we?
1,talk,13,2,5, @Midori  either check Servas tonight and tell us tomorrow  or I'm voting Servas. We need action  not more words — decide fast. Over
1,talk,14,2,2, @Shion  your focus shifts easily. If Sakura is cleared tomorrow who do you truly suspect most? I need your direct view.
1,talk,15,3,1,Servas has offered little to our discussion. I share Takumi's suspicion.
1,talk,16,3,3,Everyone's so serious! Let's think together: if Servas is quiet is that smart hiding or just shy? I love a puzzle! @Servas Hey Servas! You're kinda quiet—are you just shy or cooking up a sneaky plan? Haha! Share your thoughts with us!
1,talk,17,3,4,If we don't vote for Servas. It risks the village. His calm seems off. Like a chess move leading us into danger. Doesn't that worry you? @Servas Your distant behavior raises doubts. What’s your strategy playing werewolf are you? If you think about it isn't that interesting?
1,talk,18,3,5,I'm Takumi. Midori checked me and said I'm human  so we should trust her.  @Servas  you've been quiet and distant — what's your role? If you don't give a clear answer I'll vote you. We need to decide now. Over
1,talk,19,3,2, @Shion  your attempts to pivot suspicion feel cunning not protective. I’ll vote for you—too many changes in your targets.

2,talk,1,0,4,If you think about it... Midori's claim as seer holds water. Yet I find myself pondering Sakura's honesty. Isn't that interesting? We must vote with l
2,talk,2,0,5, @Midori  it's just the three of us. You said you checked me — prove it. Check Shion tonight and tell us tomorrow  or I'm voting you. We need certainty. Over
2,talk,3,1,1,I have discerned Shion as Takumi wished. The truth is clear. Shion is the werewolf.
2,talk,4,1,4,I've checked our roles. Midori. Your divine results seem off. If you're the true seer why not divine me again? Perhaps you've overlooked this?
2,talk,5,1,5,I'm Takumi.  @Midori  you said you're the seer and checked me — that looks like a play to gain trust. Either prove it with clear details now or I'm voting you. Who's with me? Ove
2,talk,6,2,1, @Takumi  my sight is true. You are human. Shion is the adversary. Let us claim victory.
2,talk,7,2,4,Midori's claim seems fragile. Takumi let Midori divine you. If she's truthful clarity follows. Isn't that interesting?
2,talk,8,2,5,I'm voting  @Midori . Her seer claim feels fake and she's been pushing too hard — show the exact result details now or she's getting lynched. Over
2,talk,9,3,1, @Takumi  My sight about you was true. Please trust it once more. Our victory lies in exiling Shion.
2,talk,10,3,4,Why wasn't Takumi divined sooner? His swift judgments and urgent threats. Wolfish tactics? Isn't that interesting?
2,talk,11,3,5,I'm voting  @Midori . Your "seer" claim needs real details — say exactly who you checked and what you saw right now  or you're getting lynched. Over
