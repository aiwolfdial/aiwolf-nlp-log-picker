0,talk,0,0,2,Hello my precious ones. I'm Shizue. Let's join hearts and play this game together. May we nurture joy and friendship in every moment!
0,talk,1,0,5,I'm Asuka. I'm a plain villager; I have no special power. I'll focus on logic today. @Shizue Thank you for your introduction Shizue. Let's stay practical and share information clearly.
0,talk,2,0,3,Hello everyone! I'm Shion eager to join in this thrilling game of Werewolf. Let's find those werewolves!
0,talk,3,0,1,Skip
0,talk,4,0,4,Shizue's intro felt a bit too sugary — makes me suspicious.  @Shizue  what's your read and who are you leaning to vote for? Asuka claimed plain villager; keep that in mind. Shion  Sakura any quick thoughts? Over

0,talk,9,1,4,Shizue's sugary intro still bothers me.  @Shizue  please tell us who you're planning to vote for and why — silence isn't helpful. Asuka  Shion  Sakura  quick reads? Over

0,talk,11,2,4,I'm leaning to vote  @Shizue  — that sweet intro and the silence feel off. If you disagree  say who you're voting for and why now. Quick reads? Over
0,talk,12,3,4,I'll vote  @Shizue  unless someone gives a solid reason not to. Asuka  Shion  Sakura — please state your votes now. Over

1,talk,0,0,4,Morning — any night victim to report? No claims so far. I'm still uneasy about Asuka's quietness.  @Asuka  who are you leaning to vote for and why? Shion Sakura any quick reads? Over
1,talk,1,0,5,I'm a plain villager. No special info from me. Seer share if you have findings. Let's discuss suspicions openly. @Victoria I don't have strong suspicions yet but why are you focusing on me so quickly? What's your reasoning Victoria?
1,talk,2,0,3, I divined Victoria last night and she is Human. Let's focus our suspicions elsewhere.
1,talk,3,0,1,A Seer? And you checked Victoria? Why her? She's just loud and annoying.
1,talk,4,0,2,Sweetheart. Last night my divination revealed our dear Shion is a Werewolf. We should consider voting for Shion carefully.
1,talk,5,1,4,Asuka — I questioned you earlier because your answers felt brief and inconsistent  but that was tentative.We have conflicting divination claims now @Shizue  claims they checked Shion and found Werewolf. Two seer-results can't both be true. @Shizue  are you claiming to be the seer? Explain why you targeted S
1,talk,6,1,5,Two seer claims. Both can't be telling the truth. We need to judge carefully. Let's weigh their statements and motives. @Shion  if you're truly the seer do you have a reason for prioritizing Victoria for your first divination?
1,talk,7,1,3, Absolutely I divined Victoria first to assess the more vocal player; it could provide clarity quickly in the game.
1,talk,8,1,1,Hmph two seers? So annoying. Let's just vote a quiet one today. How about you Asuka?
1,talk,9,1,2,Oh my precious Shion. Be truthful now. A true seer would look beyond one person first. Let's find serenity in honesty.
1,talk,10,2,4,Two seer claims conflict: Shion says they checked me and found Human;  @Shizue  says they checked Shion and found Werewolf. @Shizue — are you claiming seer? Give target  result  and when. If you're lying  that makes you very suspicio
1,talk,11,2,5,Shizue and Shion both claim Seer. Their stories conflict. Let's evaluate their logic and actions carefully before voting. @Sakura I see you're suggesting I should be an easy vote. Why focus on quiet players instead of examining the seer conflict?
1,talk,12,2,3, I am the true Seer. Shizue giving vague responses and claiming the Seer role falsely is suspicious. We must focus there.
1,talk,13,2,1,Voting a Seer claim is a waste of time. Asuka's done nothing useful. My vote is for Asuka.
1,talk,14,2,2,My precious ones. My divination confirms dear Shion is a Werewolf. I claim the true Seer. Trust actions over words today.  @Asuka  Stay logical and dear. Let's gently focus on Seer claims. Only one can be honest. Do you agree?
1,talk,15,3,4, @Shizue  if you're the seer  state clearly: when you checked (last night?)  who you targeted (Shion?)  and the exact result. Vague poetry won't cut it — give us con
1,talk,16,3,5,We shouldn't rush. Evaluating both seer claims' logic carefully is key. Quick votes may benefit the werewolf. @Shizue I agree we must stay logical. Will you give a precise divination sequence and result for clarity?
1,talk,17,3,3,  Trust me as the true Seer; I provided specific information. Shizue has been overly ambiguous. This is a tactic often used by a Werewolf or the Possesse
1,talk,18,3,1,Over
1,talk,19,3,2,Oh my precious. I feel Shion's path resembles the Werewolf. Let's tread with care. Always trust your instincts dear.

2,talk,0,0,5,We have one Seer claim remaining but let's clarify everyone's reasoning before voting. Avoid hasty decisions. @Sakura  yesterday you dismissed the Seer conflict. Can you explain your stance on Shizue now?
2,talk,1,0,2,My precious ones. I've divined Asuka and discovered they are a Werewolf. We should ponder this deeply in our discussions today.
2,talk,2,0,1,Hmph this game is over. I'm the werewolf and Shizue is my friend! We win
2,talk,3,1,5,Sakura's sudden confession feels like provocation or misdirection. We should assess Shizue's Seer claim logically. @Shizue  your divination result contradicts my role as Villager. How do you justify your claim after Sakura's statement?
2,talk,4,1,2,Ah my dear. Tonight's divination should center on Sakura. Her confession was sudden. Understanding her role aids in our journey.
2,talk,5,1,1,Shizue is my teammate you big dummy! It's 2 vs 1. We vote for you Asuka. Game over
2,talk,6,2,5,Sakura's open claim of Werewolf undermines her intent. Focus on actual evidence not performed theatrics. @Shizue  you're claiming I'm a Werewolf yet Sakura openly claims wolf with you. Explain the logic of your accusation.
2,talk,7,2,2,Oh my precious friends. Sakura's outburst is delightful! Let's cherish the fun dear but delve into serious talks soon.
2,talk,8,2,1,Why is this still going on?  @Asuka  you lost. Shizue and I vote for you. It's over
2,talk,9,3,5,Both Shizue and Sakura's statements lack consistency. Let's analyze calmly before voting; emotions cloud judgment. @Shizue Your claim points to me but Sakura's actions conflict with your story. Can you clarify objectively not theatrically?
2,talk,10,3,2,Oh my precious. If we protect sweet Asuka it may bring us trouble. Her ways align with the werewolf's path. She betrays us.
2,talk,11,3,1,Ugh stop talking already Asuka! You lost! Shizue and I are voting for you. This is so boring
