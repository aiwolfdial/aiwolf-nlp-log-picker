0,talk,0,0,4,Hey everyone — Mio here! I don't have any special info  but I'm a bit uneasy about  @Daisuke . Any role claims or reads? If the seer has a result  please share so we don't rush a wrong lynch. What do others think? Over
0,talk,1,0,3,Skip
0,talk,2,0,2,I'm curious about the suspicion on Daisuke. Minato any thoughts on this?
0,talk,3,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm Daisuke ready to unravel mysteries with you all. Let's have fun and find the werewolf!
0,talk,4,0,5,Hi everyone I’m Minato I get nervous at first but I’m excited to play with you all let’s work together!
0,talk,5,1,4,I'm uneasy — Minako skipped and Daisuke hasn't given any reads.  @Minato   what's your take? If the seer has a result  please share it now. If not  we should get some votes to force reactions. Over
0,talk,6,1,3,I am Minako. Let us achieve victory with haste.
0,talk,7,1,2,Minako what do you think about voting early? It might help us get reactions.

0,talk,10,2,4, @Daisuke  You only said "Over" — do you have any reads or a role to share? If no one claims seer  we should force a vote to get reactions. I'm leaning to vote for Minako

0,talk,12,2,2,Minato do you have any suspicions or strategies you want to share with us?
0,talk,13,3,4, @Minato  Do you have any reads or a vote? I'm leaning to vote for Minako to force reactions — if no one claims seer we should push. Over
0,talk,14,3,2,Daisuke what are your thoughts on Mio's suggestion to vote for Minako?

1,talk,0,0,4,Good morning! Did we lynch Minako?  @Daisuke  you were quiet — any reads or role? If the seer hasn't revealed  we should force reactions with votes. I'm not ready to decide yet. Over
1,talk,1,0,3,I am the Seer. My investigation identified Daisuke as a Werewolf. He must be executed.
1,talk,2,0,5, @Daisuke  Minako named you as the wolf so are you going to counter as seer or defend yourself at all?
1,talk,3,0,2,Daisuke what do you have to say about Minako's claim? We need your defense.
1,talk,4,0,1, I am actually the Seer and divined Minako last night. She is the Werewolf. Let's discuss this and decide carefully.
1,talk,5,1,4,This is messy — two seer claims.  @Daisuke  please explain exactly when you divined Minako (which night) and whether you checked anyone else. Minako  same question: when did you check Daisuke a
1,talk,6,1,3,The composition is clear. I am the Seer. Daisuke is the Werewolf. The Possessed remains hidden.
1,talk,7,1,5,@Mio  @Victoria  which Seer do you believe right now? Let’s be clear who we suspect so the wolf can’t hide.
1,talk,8,1,2,I'm unsure who to trust yet. Both claims are risky. Let's analyze carefully.
1,talk,9,1,1, I checked Minako on the very first night and saw she is the Werewolf. Trust me I am the true Seer. Let's unite and vote against the real threat.
1,talk,10,2,4,This is messy — two seer claims.  @Daisuke  please say exactly which night you divined Minako and who else you checked. Minako  when did you check Daisuke and any other targets? If Daisuke can't g
1,talk,11,2,3,Hesitation ensures defeat. My intelligence is clear. My vote is for Daisuke.
1,talk,12,2,5, @Victoria  can you say clearly who you trust more between Minako and Daisuke? We need stronger positions to find the wolf.
1,talk,13,2,2,Minato I lean towards Minako's claim but I'm open to more discussion.
1,talk,14,2,1,  I divined Minako on the first night confirming her as the Werewolf. I am the real Seer and have no reason to deceive you.
1,talk,15,3,4,Two seer claims is too confusing.  @Daisuke  please state exactly which night(s) you divined  who you checked  and why you were so quiet yesterday. If you can't give specifics I'll vote to lynch you
1,talk,16,3,3,There is no room for doubt. My intelligence identified Daisuke as the threat. Execute him.
1,talk,17,3,5,I believe Minako is more convincing so my vote goes to Daisuke. Splitting votes helps the wolf so let’s stick together.
1,talk,18,3,2,I'm with Minako and Minato on this. Let's vote together for clarity.
1,talk,19,3,1, I divined Minako as a Werewolf on the very first night. There were no other nights to check yet. Trust me I'm the true Seer.
