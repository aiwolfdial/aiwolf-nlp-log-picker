1,talk,0,0,2, Last night I divined Takumi his result showed he is Human. We can trust him today let's focus our suspicions elsewhere.
1,talk,1,0,3,Minato thank you for making your seer claim. It is timely. I remain the same plain villager as I said yesterday. @Minato  do you have any thoughts on Servas or Minako? I would like more of your reasoning beyond the divination.
1,talk,2,0,1,I am the real Seer. I divined Servas; they are Human. Let's consider our options and work together to find the Werewolf.
1,talk,3,0,5, @Minato  why did you choose Takumi to divine? It feels like avoiding suspicion—care to explain your reasoning?
1,talk,4,0,4,Wow two Seers! Thanks Minato for the check! I trust you. That means Minako is the fake right?
1,talk,5,1,2, I chose Takumi based on his positive attitude. It was necessary to check someone enthusiastic as they could be a key player whether Villager or Werewo
1,talk,6,1,3,Two seer claims both found Human. We need to consider their motives and listen carefully to both claims. @Minako  you claim Servas is Human. Why did you pick Servas for divination? Please share your thought process with us.
1,talk,7,1,1,Let's consider this carefully. I chose Servas for their insights. Minato's claim seems suspicious. Let's uncover the real threat quickly.
1,talk,8,1,5, @Takumi  you trust Minato too quickly. Isn’t that reckless? What made you so sure about his Seer claim?
1,talk,9,1,4, @Servas  Of course I trust him he said I'm human! So it's a real Seer vs a Possessed one right?
1,talk,10,2,2, I urge everyone to vote for Minako. Despite claiming to be a Seer her behavior and aggressive denial question her credibility.
1,talk,11,2,3,Both Seer claims could be telling the truth or lying. Let us analyze their logic and behavior before drawing conclusions. @Takumi  blind trust in one claim is risky. We should debate both claims and examine all evidence on the table.
1,talk,12,2,1,Given the odds Minato might be Possessed. Let's consider voting him out to secure the Seer role in this discussion. George. What are your thoughts on M
1,talk,13,2,5,Choosing between  @Minako  and @Minato is risky—what if both are lying? @Takumi your quick trust seems dangerous.
1,talk,14,2,4,Yeah I'm voting for Minako too! Minato said I'm human so he has to be the real Seer right? Let's go
1,talk,15,3,2,Minako's approach in trying to discredit me without substantial reason seems to be an attempt to shift suspicion away since I exposed her lie. Vote Mi
1,talk,16,3,3,We have two Seer claims both with Human results. A careful review of each claim's reasoning is needed before voting. @Servas  your point about the risk if both Seers are lying is valid. Let's weigh each claim's logic side by side.
1,talk,17,3,1,Let's consider Minato's assertive claim. Is it to deflect attention? A real Seer would surely share insights without pressure.
1,talk,18,3,5,Both Seers feel off.  @Minato 's push for votes is suspicious to me. I choose to vote Minato.

2,talk,0,0,4,My luck turned around! I'm the Werewolf and Minato is my partner! Sorry George we win! Vote George
2,talk,1,0,2,George I ask you to vote for Takumi today. My divination results may have been incorrect and his behavior allies closely with a Werewolf's tactics.
2,talk,2,0,3,Takumi's confession may be a bluff. Yet the timing is suspicious. Let's keep calm and think this through before voting. @Minato  can you clarify what made you doubt your earlier divination and now suspect Takumi? I want to hear your reasoning.
2,talk,3,1,4,Huh?!  @Minato  what's the big idea? We won! Just vote George already! C'mon
2,talk,4,1,2, George here's my reasoning: Takumi's eagerness and quick trust were too overly convenient possibly a tactic to distract and end debate swiftly.
2,talk,5,1,3,I am not swayed by confessions meant to force our hand. Logic must lead our decision. Takumi or Minato one deceives us. @Takumi  confession aside what changed your approach from trusting Minato to openly claiming Werewolf today?
2,talk,6,2,4, @George  It's a trap! Minato is the Werewolf! He's sacrificing me to win your trust! Don't listen
2,talk,7,2,2, Takumi's behavior during voting was too aggressive and self-assured; typical for a Werewolf trying to win. His sudden shift in tactics is revealing
2,talk,8,2,3,Both sides accuse one another. I see a forced play from Takumi trying to end the discussion. That to me is suspicious. @Takumi  your strategy changed drastically. Is your claim genuine or simply a tactic to force my vote against Minato?
2,talk,9,3,4, @George  See?! He's betraying me! He said I was human just to set this up! He's the real wolf
2,talk,10,3,2,George recall Minako and Servas were attacked after claiming I might be suspicious. This tactic signals Takumi's desperation to deflect suspicion
2,talk,11,3,3,Given the timing and pressure Takumi's confession aligns with desperation. I am voting for Takumi to protect the village. @Minato  your reasoning is duly noted. I will trust your judgment and place my vote on Takumi today.
