1,talk,0,0,4,Morning all! Any insights from last night? Let's hear some thoughts and theories!
1,talk,1,0,2, @Toshio  who did you divine last night and what was the result? We need clear info to start finding the wolf.
1,talk,2,0,1,...
1,talk,3,0,3,Mr. Toshio claims to be the seer. I believe we should consider his divination on Day 1 crucial. It may guide our actions thoughtfully.
1,talk,4,0,5,I am a seer. I divined Minato and Minato was a human.
1,talk,5,1,4,Thanks for the info Toshio. So Minato's human but what about the rest of us? Thoughts?
1,talk,6,1,2, @Minato  Toshio cleared you as human today—do you trust his CO or think it might be a wolf’s trick?
1,talk,7,1,1,...
1,talk,8,1,3,We should deliberate upon the next divination target. We must consider Mr. Minato's results. Do you value his findings or see strategy?
1,talk,9,1,5,I will vote Minako.
1,talk,10,2,4,Toshio any reason for targeting Minako? Curious to hear your thoughts.
1,talk,11,2,2, @Toshio  your vote felt random—can you explain your reasoning? Singling out easy targets is suspicious this early.
1,talk,12,2,1,...
1,talk,13,2,3,I believe divining those yet to be cleared is logical. Perhaps choosing Ms. Minako or myself would provide the necessary clarity?
1,talk,14,2,5,I will vote Minako.
1,talk,15,3,4,Victoria raises a good point. Toshio is there a reason Minako stands out to you?
1,talk,16,3,2,Toshio keeps voting for me without any reason. That feels too random for a true Seer. I’ll vote Toshio today.
1,talk,17,3,1,...
1,talk,18,3,3,I believe if Ms. May seems too eager to agree without insights one might wonder if she conceals her intentions as the wolf. @Minato Ms. May has indeed sparked my curiosity. In my opinion her intentions are ambiguous. They may either support or oppose the village.
1,talk,19,3,5,I will vote Minako.

2,talk,0,0,4,With Toshio gone we need to rethink. Minato Victoria where do we stand now?
2,talk,1,0,3,I believe Toshio's elimination after claiming to be the seer is cause for reflection. Minato's actions seem strategically suspect. What do you thin

2,talk,3,1,4,Victoria I think we should focus on Minato's actions today. What do you think?

2,talk,6,2,4,Minato you’ve been quiet. Any thoughts on how to proceed after last night’s events?
2,talk,7,2,3,I believe Toshio's role claim and subsequent elimination suggest that Mr. Minato is indeed a prudent choice. Anyone divined today warrants suspici
2,talk,8,2,1,...
2,talk,9,3,4,Victoria we should weigh Minato's actions carefully. Any other suspicions or ideas?
2,talk,10,3,3,I believe if we allow Mr. Minato's actions to persist unchecked we risk failure. A lack of transparency seems werewolf-like. Why has Mr. Minato not be @May I believe we should focus on Mr. Minato's behavior today. Their evasiveness has been concerning. Are you sensing something similar?
