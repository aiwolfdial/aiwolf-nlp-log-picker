0,talk,0,0,4,Hello. I am Mizuki. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,1,0,2,Glad to see everyone gathered. Careful observation is key—who here prefers to share early or to watch silently?
0,talk,2,0,1,I prefer to watch and gather info before speaking. I'll mostly listen today.  @Mizuki  — why claim villager so early? Over

0,talk,4,0,3,Let's work together and stay observant. Sharing thoughts helps us understand each other better.

0,talk,7,1,1,I'm still uneasy about that quick 'villager' claim.  @Mizuki  — why declare so early? If no solid answer  I'm inclined to vote you. Others  what do you think? Over
0,talk,8,1,5,Over
0,talk,9,1,3,Let's give Mizuki a chance to explain. Early claims can be risky but not always suspicious.
0,talk,10,2,1,Ryuji  I hear you  but that quick claim still bothers me.  @Mizuki  — why claim villager so early? Any concrete reason or action to share? If nothing convincing  I may lean to vote later. Others  impressions? Over
0,talk,11,2,3,We should be patient and hear Mizuki's response before jumping to conclusions.
0,talk,12,3,1,I don't want to rush a lynch without evidence.  @Mizuki  — if you're really villager  tell us why you claimed so early and who you trust or distrust. If it's vague  I may lean to vote later. Others  any strong reads
0,talk,13,3,3,No strong reads yet but let's focus on gathering more info and see how everyone reacts.

1,talk,0,0,3,Let's hear everyone's thoughts on yesterday. Any new insights or suspicions to share?
1,talk,1,0,5,...
1,talk,2,0,1,I already said I'm the seer — I divined  @Mizuki  as WEREWOLF on night 0. I'll vote them now. If anyone has a counterclaim  protection  or proof  speak up; otherwise let's lynch. Over
1,talk,3,0,2, @Servas  Your silence worries me in this tight game. Please speak up so we can judge everyone fairly.
1,talk,4,0,4,I will vote Shion.
1,talk,5,1,3,Toshio's claim is serious. We need everyone's input especially from Servas to decide wisely.
1,talk,6,1,5,...
1,talk,7,1,1,I'm the seer — I divined  @Mizuki  as WEREWOLF on night 0. Their vote for Shion looks like a deflection. Vote them today. If anyone has protection or a counterclaim  speak now. Over
1,talk,8,1,2, @Servas  you’ve been silent all round Why not share your thoughts now? We need every voice to find the wolf
1,talk,9,1,4,Over
1,talk,10,2,3,If Servas stays silent it might signal something. Let's proceed cautiously with evidence.
1,talk,11,2,5,...
1,talk,12,2,1,I've already said I'm the seer — I divined  @Mizuki  as WEREWOLF on night 0. Their vote for Shion looks like a deflection. Servas  Ryuji  Shion — any protection or counterclaim? If not  I'll vote Mizuki. Ove
1,talk,13,2,2, @Mizuki  You just voted me right after Toshio’s CO. Defend yourself. What makes you think I’m wolf over Toshio?
1,talk,14,3,3,I have no counterclaim. Mizuki you need to address Toshio's accusation directly.
1,talk,15,3,5,...
1,talk,16,3,1,I am the seer. I divined  @Mizuki  on night 0 — result: WEREWOLF. I'll cast my vote for them. Any objections or protective claims? Over
1,talk,17,3,2,Based on Toshio's seer claim and Mizuki’s response I’ll vote Mizuki today. If Servas disagrees now’s the time to speak up.
