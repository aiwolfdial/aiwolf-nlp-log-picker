0,talk,0,0,5,Ah greetings to all. Allow me to introduce myself as Servas. Together let us delve into this game like a gardener tends to his plants.
0,talk,1,0,1,Hello. I am Misaki. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,2,I'm skeptical.  @Misaki   if you're truly the seer  tell us your Night 0 divination — who you checked and the result. Everyone else  speak up with claims or reads. Over
0,talk,3,0,3,Hello everyone I'm Shizue. Let's work calmly together to find the werewolves.

0,talk,10,2,2, @Misaki  — Night 0 divination: who and result? Explain why you declared immediately. If you can't  I'll treat you as suspect. Anyone else with a claim or a read  sp
0,talk,11,2,3,It's important for Misaki to clarify their divination so we can proceed carefully.
0,talk,12,3,2, @Misaki  — you already claimed seer. Last chance: state your Night 0 divination (target + result) or I’ll vote you at the first lynch. Anyone with supporting in

1,talk,0,0,3,Good morning everyone. Let's share any new insights to guide today's decisions.
1,talk,1,0,5,I divined last night that dear Ms. Misaki is the Werewolf. Shall we unite today my kind friend to confirm and plan our vote?
1,talk,2,0,4,Given Servas’s black check and Misaki’s vague CO I find Misaki the most suspicious right now.
1,talk,3,0,2,Servas claims he divined  @Misaki  black and Mizuki backs that. I’ll vote them unless someone has concrete counterevidence. Over
1,talk,4,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Servas and Servas was a human.
1,talk,5,1,3,We have conflicting seer claims; let's discuss calmly and decide the best course.
1,talk,6,1,5,Ah my dear Misaki claims that I am but a mere human. Yet my divination suggests a different truth. Do consult Shion as their objectivity is akin to a bala
1,talk,7,1,4,Based on Servas’s black result voting Misaki seems safest unless someone has a strong reason to doubt Servas.
1,talk,8,1,2,Calm down.  @Servas  — when exactly did you divine Misaki as black and what was the exact result? Why should we trust you over Misaki’s seer claim? If you can't clarify  I'll k
1,talk,9,1,1,I will vote Servas.
1,talk,10,2,3,Let's focus on facts and reasoning to sort out the truth between these claims.
1,talk,11,2,5,My dear Mizuki. I ask you to trust the rhythm of truth. Between Misaki and myself. Only one reflects the real seer's light.
1,talk,12,2,4, @Shizue  unless Misaki gives clear proof I think we should vote her as Servas’s claim fits the facts so far.
1,talk,13,2,2, @Servas  exactly when did you divine (Night 0?) and what was the precise result wording? If you can't answer clearly I'll stick with voting Misaki. Others  give
1,talk,14,2,1,Over
1,talk,15,3,3,We need clear evidence from both sides; rash decisions won't help us find the truth.
1,talk,16,3,5,Oh my dear what intricate webs do we craft! Why does Ms. Misaki reveal her seerhood now when shadows loom so ominously?
1,talk,17,3,4,It’s vital we vote decisively. I will vote Misaki based on Servas’s black result and the inconsistencies in her responses.
1,talk,18,3,2, @Servas  — state which night you divined and the exact result wording (target + result). If you can’t clarify  I’ll vote Misaki. Others  quick reads or claims now

2,talk,0,0,3,Good morning. Let's focus on understanding last night's events and plan our next steps.
2,talk,1,0,4,Shizue has been very neutral all game. That’s smart for hiding. Shouldn’t we reconsider her lack of input?
2,talk,2,0,2,Misaki was executed and Servas was attacked.  @Mizuki  please reveal your Night divination(s) — target(s) and result(s) — or at least give your reads. Shizue  any quick thoughts? I’ll hold my vote for now. O
2,talk,3,1,3,I'm inclined to trust Mizuki for now but Shion's insights are valuable for balance.
2,talk,4,1,4, @Shion  your heavy questioning seems like a way to steer suspicion off yourself are you hiding something?
2,talk,5,1,2,We lost Misaki and Servas.  @Mizuki   reveal your night divination(s): who and result. Shizue  any reads? I’m holding my vote until Mizuki speaks. Over
2,talk,6,2,3,Without clear results from Mizuki I'm wary. Let's stay observant and discuss further.
2,talk,7,2,4, @Shion  I’m the real Seer and my last night’s result was black on you. We must vote out the real wolf before we lose.
2,talk,8,2,2,Misaki and Servas are gone.  @Mizuki   reveal your Night divination(s) — who and result — now. We need concrete info to decide. Others  quick reads or I’ll start voting. Over
2,talk,9,3,3,Mizuki's claim is serious; if true we should act. Shion any defense or counter?
2,talk,10,3,4,I’m voting Shion. My black divination result confirms her as wolf. Shizue let’s protect the village and end this.
2,talk,11,3,2, @Mizuki  — state your night divination(s) now (target + result) or I can't trust your claim. Shizue — quick read? I won't vote until we get Mizuki's answer. Over
