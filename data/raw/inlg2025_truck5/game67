0,talk,0,0,2,Is everyone sharpening their wits or just their acting skills? I’m eager to see whose mask slips first tonight.
0,talk,1,0,5,Hello everyone! I'm Victoria ready to unveil the mystery—are you? Let's have fun and find those werewolves!

1,talk,0,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Toshio and Toshio was a human.
1,talk,1,0,3,Kenji's claim that he divined me human feels convenient — could be a fake seer trying to protect someone. We shouldn't accept it without specifics. We @May  you're quiet — what's your read or any role info? Over
1,talk,2,0,5, I divined Kenji last night and he turned out to be a Werewolf. Let's focus and solve this as early as possible.
1,talk,3,0,4,Victoria's claim is indeed serious. Kenji's human result upon Toshio supports it. In my opinion we must know what May thinks next.
1,talk,4,0,2,@Victoria if you’re the real Seer Kenji’s claim falls apart fast.  @Mizuki  who do you believe more at this point?
1,talk,5,1,1,I will vote Victoria.
1,talk,6,1,3, @Victoria  which night did you divine Kenji and what exactly was the result? Mizuki  you backed her — what specifically made you trust Victoria? Kenji voting Vict
1,talk,7,1,5, I need to retract my Seer claim. I mistakenly believed it would help expose the Werewolf by drawing out reactions but it appears Kenji might be the Were
1,talk,8,1,4,In my opinion dear May Victoria's retraction leaves us in a curious situation. Kenji stands as the sole seer claimant now. What do you think?
1,talk,9,1,2,Victoria’s fake CO muddied things—I lean to vote Kenji unless someone else steps up with solid reasons.
1,talk,10,2,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,11,2,3, @Kenji  you claimed seer and said you divined me human — now you vote Toshio. Which is it? State exactly when you divined and why you're voting him. Victoria  if y
1,talk,12,2,5, Let's vote for Kenji. His claim as a Seer doesn't add up with his actions. As a real Seer I revealed he's a Werewolf. We should trust my divination.
1,talk,13,2,4,In my opinion dear Victoria raises an intriguing point about the twists. Kenji's actions are indeed suspect so perhaps we follow May's lead?
1,talk,14,2,2, @Kenji  your CO feels shaky and your voting’s all over the place. Why should anyone trust you as Seer?
1,talk,15,3,1,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,16,3,3,Let's clarify claims and timelines—if you have a role claim state exactly when (night1  night2  etc.) and what you got.  @Mizuki  you backed someone earlier—what specific behavior made you trust them? I'll hold off voting until we get concrete reasons. Over
1,talk,17,3,5, Kenji's behavior and votes do not align with his claim as Seer. RandomForest his actual role doesn't match his votes. We should vote for Kenji based on
1,talk,18,3,4,Kenji's votes directly contradict his seer claims. In my opinion trusting him might jeopardize everything we value as villagers. @Victoria Kenji's actions seem to sow doubt. In my opinion. We must unite for the safety of our village. It's crucial dear friends.
1,talk,19,3,2,Kenji’s contradictions are too risky—I’m voting Kenji. Victoria Mizuki Toshio  let’s unite and not hand victory to the wolf.

2,talk,0,0,5,Kenji was a wise choice to exile based on inconsistent behavior. Let's stay focused and vigilant tonight.
2,talk,1,0,2, @Mizuki  you’ve dodged every decision so far who are you voting today and why shouldn’t we think you’re the wolf?
2,talk,2,0,4,The seer might have divined key details by now. If they're wise we'll learn much more about the wolf soon. In my opinion. May dear I am sorry. I understan
2,talk,3,1,5, Mizuki as the Possessed I urge you to vote for May. Let's end this game in our favor! Tonight I divined and Kenji was not a Werewolf.
2,talk,4,1,2, @Victoria  your divination changed fast. Why is Mizuki the wolf but not you? Explain clearly or I’ll be voting you.
2,talk,5,1,4,In my opinion Victoria's inconsistency with divination is concerning. Dear May clear results are crucial. Let's use divination wisely.

2,talk,7,2,2, @Mizuki  you’ve dodged a claim all game. If you’re not the wolf prove it now—CO or show your side before voting.
2,talk,8,2,4, @May  Victoria's actions and claims seem quite suspicious. Dear friend. In my opinion. It's crucial we stay cautious of her next words.
2,talk,9,3,5,  Mizuki as the Possessed I must implore you to vote for May with me. Her removal will secure our victory. Let's not falter now.
2,talk,10,3,2, @Mizuki  you stayed silent while Victoria shifted sides. No CO from you. I’m voting Mizuki unless you give me a reason not to.
2,talk,11,3,4,In my opinion dear friend we must scrutinize Victoria's actions. It's crucial to differentiate between a genuine ally and a potential wolf.
