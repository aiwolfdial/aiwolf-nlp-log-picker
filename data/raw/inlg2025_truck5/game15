0,talk,1,0,5,Hello. I am Mio. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,2,Thanks  Mio — noted.  @Kenji   what's your role and who do you suspect? Toshio  you skipped — any reason? I'm not ready to vote yet. Over
0,talk,3,0,4,Hey everyone I’m Kenji—let's make this a fun and fair game together. Who’s up for sharing their thoughts first?
0,talk,4,0,3,Hi everyone I'm Servas! Ready for some thrilling Werewolf action? Let's uncover the mysteries together!
0,talk,5,1,1,My name is Toshio. Apologies. I was observing the terms of our engagement. Order requires contemplation.
0,talk,6,1,5,Over
0,talk,7,1,2,Let's do quick reads — name one suspect and one short reason. I'll wait to vote until I hear them.  @Kenji  — who do you suspect and why? Toshio  Servas  Mio — one line each please. Over

1,talk,0,0,3, I'm holding back on voting and don't have a solid suspect yet. Still gathering info.
1,talk,1,0,4, @Toshio  you’re being quiet. Are you going to claim your role or wait for someone else to speak up first?
1,talk,2,0,2, @Toshio  Please answer Kenji — will you claim a role or keep observing? Servas  can you at least name one suspect so we can move toward a vote? Over
1,talk,3,0,5,I will vote Victoria.
1,talk,4,0,1,My contract compels me to speak. I am the Seer. Victoria was revealed to me as the Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,3,Vote for Victoria please! Her actions are suspicious and Toshio's divination revealed her as the Werewolf.
1,talk,6,1,4, @Victoria  Toshio claims you are the Werewolf. What do you say to defend yourself? This is important for our vote.
1,talk,7,1,2,I'm not the werewolf. I'm the real Seer — last night I divined  @Kenji  and he was HUMAN. Toshio's seer claim is false; he's the one to suspect. Don't lynch me — vote Toshio instead. Over
1,talk,8,1,5,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,9,1,1,Two visions are before us. I saw the wolf. She creates a human shield. This pact with  @Kenji  is false.
1,talk,10,2,3,Based on Toshio revealing me as the Werewolf vote for Victoria. Her claim after being exposed doesn't add up.
1,talk,11,2,4,I was scanned “human” by Victoria so if she’s the real Seer Toshio has to be the wolf.
1,talk,12,2,2,I am the real Seer. I divined Kenji last night — HUMAN.  @Toshio  your seer claim is fake; you're lying. Don't lynch me — vote Toshio. Servas  Mio  why are you pushing Victoria? Kenji  any reads? Over
1,talk,13,2,5,I will vote Victoria.
1,talk,14,2,1,Observe the timing. My testimony was given. Hers was a rebuttal. Truth does not require a prompt.
1,talk,15,3,3,Keep your vote on Victoria. Toshio's divination came before her claim which makes her reaction seem defensive.
1,talk,16,3,4, @Servas  @Mio Victoria scanned me human which matches my true role so I trust her CO and will vote Toshio as werewolf.
1,talk,17,3,2,I divined Kenji last night — HUMAN.  @Toshio  your seer claim is fake; you accused me falsely. Mio  Servas — why are you pushing me? Give a concrete reason or I'll vote Toshio. Kenji any reads? Over
1,talk,18,3,5,I will vote Victoria.

2,talk,0,0,5,I will vote Toshio.
2,talk,1,0,1,The contract is fulfilled. The scales are balanced. Our victory is absolute.
2,talk,2,0,3,Mio let's vote Toshio out today. The evidence suggests he's the Werewolf since only Victoria was falsely accused and attacked.
2,talk,3,1,5,I will vote Servas.
2,talk,4,1,1,Further struggle is futile. The conditions for victory were met at dawn. It is done.
2,talk,5,1,3,Mio let's vote for Toshio. His divination claim against Victoria was proven false by her correct human scan on Kenji.
2,talk,6,2,5,I will vote Toshio.
2,talk,7,2,1,It is as I have stated. I am the Possessed. The game is concluded.
2,talk,8,2,3,Mio vote Toshio today. His false claim as Seer and targeting Victoria match werewolf behavior since she divined Kenji correctly.
2,talk,9,3,5,I will vote Toshio.
2,talk,10,3,1,The contract is concluded. I am the Possessed. Further deliberation is without merit.
2,talk,11,3,3,Mio stick with voting Toshio. He lied about being the Seer which points to him actually being the Werewolf especially after Victoria's accurate divi
