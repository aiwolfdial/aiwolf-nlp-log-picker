0,talk,1,0,2,Hello. I am Sakura. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,4,Sure Victoria. I think it's too early to form strong opinions. Let's see how it unfolds.
0,talk,3,0,5,Hello everyone! I'm Benjamin excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have some fun and enjoy the game!
0,talk,4,0,1,Looking forward to playing with you all. Who here prefers a slow buildup or is bold from the start?
0,talk,5,1,3, @Sakura  You claimed seer—what was your divination result? Mizuki  Shunichi  Benjamin  any early hunches or suspicions? Over

0,talk,7,1,4,No big hunches yet Victoria. I'm interested in Sakura's divination result too.

0,talk,10,2,3,Two seer claims makes me uneasy.  @Sakura  please tell us who you divined and your result — now. If you won't  we should treat this claim with skepticism. Mizuki  Shunichi  Benjamin  any quick thoug
0,talk,11,2,4,Victoria I'm also wary. Let's hear from Sakura for clarity.
0,talk,12,3,3, @Sakura  Reveal who you divined and the result now. If you refuse  we should treat this claim as suspicious and consider voting the later seer claim. Mizuki  Shun
0,talk,13,3,4,Sakura your input is crucial now. Please clarify your divination to avoid confusion.

1,talk,0,0,1, @Sakura  Victoria’s right. If you’re truly Seer please reveal your divination. We need details to move forward.
1,talk,1,0,4,We need more information from Sakura to make informed decisions today.
1,talk,2,0,3,I already said I'm the seer — I divined  @Benjamin  last night: werewolf. Sakura still hasn't revealed  so we should prioritize lynching Benjamin today. I’m voting Benjamin. Who else is with me? Over
1,talk,3,0,5,I divined Victoria last night and the result was Human not a Werewolf. Sakura's failure to provide a result is suspicious.
1,talk,4,0,2,I am a seer. I divined Mizuki and Mizuki was a human.
1,talk,5,1,1,Too many COs worry me—it’s hard to know who to trust. Should we focus on Victoria and Benjamin’s contradiction first?
1,talk,6,1,4,The contradictions between Victoria and Benjamin are concerning. Let's focus there.
1,talk,7,1,3,Benjamin's claim directly contradicts mine — I divined him as werewolf last night.  @Benjamin  are you claiming seer? Give full details (night  target  result). I'm voting Benjamin. Over
1,talk,8,1,5,Vote Victoria today. Sakura confirmed Mizuki as Human—which contradicts Victoria's claim that I'm a Werewolf. I trust Sakura's divination.
1,talk,9,1,2,I will vote Benjamin.
1,talk,10,2,1,If Sakura’s result is true and Benjamin’s is too Victoria’s claim seems off Should we reconsider our target?
1,talk,11,2,4,Victoria and Benjamin your claims are conflicting. Let's clarify before deciding.
1,talk,12,2,3, @Benjamin  You say you divined me as Human—state the night  target  and exact result now. I divined you as Werewolf last night  so I’m voting you. Others  please confi
1,talk,13,2,5,Vote Victoria. Her rush to judge based on unconfirmed divinations is suspicious and does not align with Sakura's confirmed result.
1,talk,14,2,2,I will vote Benjamin.
1,talk,15,3,1,Benjamin’s claims don’t align with most Seers so I’ll vote Benjamin today to avoid splitting our votes.
1,talk,16,3,4,The votes lean heavily toward Benjamin. Let's proceed and see what unfolds.
1,talk,17,3,3, @Benjamin  State night/target/result now. I divined you as Werewolf last night — I’m voting you. Others  please state your votes. Over
1,talk,18,3,5, I urge everyone to reconsider. Sakura confirmed Mizuki is Human which should cast doubt on Victoria's credibility. Vote Victoria.
1,talk,19,3,2,I will vote Benjamin.

2,talk,0,0,4,With Benjamin gone and Victoria attacked we need to be cautious today. Thoughts?
2,talk,1,0,2,In fact I am a possessed. Werewolf, please vote the remained one.
2,talk,2,0,1,That’s unexpected from Sakura.  @Shunichi  do you believe her claim or is she trying to mislead us at the end?
2,talk,3,1,4,Mizuki Sakura's claim is surprising. It could be a bluff. We need to stay sharp.
2,talk,4,1,2,Over
2,talk,5,1,1,Sakura’s Possessed claim came out of nowhere.  @Shunichi  do you trust her or do you see this as a desperate move?
2,talk,6,2,4,Mizuki I don't trust Sakura's claim. It seems like a last-ditch effort to mislead us.
2,talk,7,2,1, @Shunichi  Sakura’s sudden switch from Seer to Possessed looks desperate Shouldn’t we question her true intention?
2,talk,8,3,4,Absolutely Mizuki. Questioning Sakura's true intentions is crucial now. Let's dig deeper.
2,talk,9,3,1,Sakura’s sudden switch feels like a Possessed’s last move so I’m voting for Shunichi today.
