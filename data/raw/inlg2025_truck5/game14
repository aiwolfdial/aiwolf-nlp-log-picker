0,talk,0,0,5,Good morning everyone. I'm Midori. I don't have any leads yet—anyone want to share role claims or night info?  @Benjamin   could you tell us who you suspect and why? I'd rather we avoid rushing into a vote.

0,talk,2,0,2,It’s delightful seeing everyone gathered—though I suspect some might be here for more than just pleasant talk.
0,talk,3,0,4,Let's share thoughts and observe behavior. Any early insights Kenji or Sakura?
0,talk,4,0,3,Hello everyone! I'm Kenji. Ready for a thrilling game of Werewolf? Let's find out who's hiding what!
0,talk,5,1,5,Good morning. I still don't have clear leads. Kenji seems a bit over-enthusiastic  which makes me uneasy.  @Kenji   who would you nominate for an early vote and why? Benjamin  could you expand on your suspicion? I'd like to gather more before voting. Over

0,talk,11,2,4,I agree Midori. Let's focus on gathering more insights before making any moves.
0,talk,12,3,5,I think we should avoid an early lynch and ask for role claims first.  @Benjamin  could you say who you suspect and why  or share any night info if you have it? Let's use today to ask questions and observe behavior. Over

1,talk,0,0,2, @Sakura  your quietness stands out. In a small game silence worries me more than words. What's your take on things so far?
1,talk,1,0,3, Just observing for now! Trying to get a sense of everyone's approach to the game.
1,talk,2,0,5,Good morning. Let's hear from everyone before voting.  @Sakura  could you share your thoughts or any role info? Benjamin  you said silence worries you—what made you suspect Sakura specifically? I'd like role claim
1,talk,3,0,4,Let's hear from Sakura. What are your thoughts? We need everyone's input.
1,talk,4,0,1,...
1,talk,5,1,2, @Midori  your eagerness to push for claims feels forced for so little info. Is that a cover or just village nerves?
1,talk,6,1,3, I'm the Seer and my divination last night showed Sakura as the Werewolf. We need to focus on her.
1,talk,7,1,5, @Kenji  that seer claim and the sudden target on Sakura feels sudden—can you explain exactly when and how you divined and whether you received a formal result
1,talk,8,1,4,Kenji's claim is serious. Sakura do you have anything to say in your defense?
1,talk,9,1,1,...
1,talk,10,2,2,Kenji’s Seer claim came fast. Before we vote Sakura shouldn’t we hear from everyone especially Ryuji and Midori?
1,talk,11,2,3, I divined last night and was informed that Sakura is a Werewolf. I assure you it's true. Let's not waste any more time.
1,talk,12,2,5, @Kenji  please give specifics of your divination—when did you check Sakura and what exact result did you get? If you can't provide details  your claim isn't he
1,talk,13,2,4,Kenji if your claim is true we need clear details. Let's proceed carefully.
1,talk,14,2,1,...
1,talk,15,3,2,Muted defense from Sakura isn’t helping her case with or without Kenji’s claim.
1,talk,16,3,3, I am the true Seer. Last night I divined Sakura and clearly saw she is the Werewolf. Trust me and let's protect the village.
1,talk,17,3,5, @Kenji  please give the exact night you divined and the precise result. If you can't  your claim looks weak and I'll be suspicious. I don't want to lynch without
1,talk,18,3,4,We need to be sure before acting. Kenji clarity is key. Midori any other thoughts?

2,talk,1,0,4,Midori's loss is significant. Kenji did you divine any new information last night?
2,talk,2,0,3, My divination results are true; I divined Sakura as a Werewolf on the first night. Trust my role as Seer and let's vote her out to save the village.
2,talk,3,1,1,...
2,talk,4,1,4,If Kenji's claim is true we can't ignore it. Sakura any defense or explanation?
2,talk,5,1,3,  Sakura hasn't defended herself from my divination claim. This silence could be an indicator of her being the Werewolf. Let's vote wisely.
2,talk,6,2,1,...
2,talk,7,2,4,Sakura if you have any explanation or defense now is the time to speak up.
2,talk,8,2,3,  Sakura's continuous silence under accusation is more than suspicious. It's best for the village if we vote her out today.
2,talk,9,3,1,...
2,talk,10,3,4,Without any response from Sakura we may need to proceed with caution but take action.
2,talk,11,3,3,  Sakura's silence in her defense is a red flag. Trust my Seer insight and let's vote for Sakura today to ensure our village's safety.
