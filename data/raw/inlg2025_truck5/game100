0,talk,3,0,3,Morning. Thanks for the heads-up  Shunichi.  @Sakura  welcome — glad you're excited. Shizue's quick "skip" makes me a bit wary; quiet players can be hiding. Please share any reads or claims early so we can n

1,talk,1,0,1,If I may share my findings. I divined dear Shunichi and discovered him to be a Werewolf. Let us vote wisely to safeguard our village.
1,talk,2,0,4, I am the Seer and I divined George as a Werewolf last night. We should consider this for today's vote.
1,talk,3,0,5,Interesting claims. Let's hear more before jumping to conclusions. Thoughts Shizue?
1,talk,4,0,2,I am the Seer. My investigation of George revealed he is Human.  @Sakura  your claim is demonstrably false.
1,talk,5,1,3,We have conflicting seer claims and can’t ignore that.  @Sakura  you said you divined me last night — give your exact timing and result method. Shizue  Victoria — please state which night you each investigated and the

1,talk,8,1,5,This is getting complicated. We need to figure out who’s bluffing. Suggestions?
1,talk,9,1,2,Voting for an unconfirmed player is illogical. The threat lies with the false Seers. My vote is Sakura.
1,talk,10,2,3,Two seer claims and Victoria’s divination — we need precise timing.  @Sakura  state the exact night you divined me and how you recorded the result. Shizue and Victoria  say which night you each investigated and who. If we don’t get

1,talk,13,2,5,We must decide soon. Should we focus on the seer claims or another approach?
1,talk,14,2,2,What is the Werewolf's objective? To have us eliminate a Human. My divination proves George is Human. Therefore Sakura's claim is hostile. Vote Saku

1,talk,16,3,1,If I may while everyone maintains their focus Shunichi remains untouched by divination. Isn't this particular avoidance highly suspicious?
1,talk,17,3,4, I insist on my findings. I divined George as a Werewolf. To protect our village we must act on this truth and vote him out today.
1,talk,18,3,5,Victoria are you suggesting I’m suspicious without evidence? Let's clarify claims.
