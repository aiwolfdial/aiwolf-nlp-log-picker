0,talk,0,0,2,Hello. I am Victoria. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,1,0,4,Thanks for the claim  Victoria. Early villager claims can be fishy.  @Minako   any role or insight to share? Over
0,talk,2,0,3,Let's approach this carefully. Minako any thoughts or role you'd like to share?
0,talk,3,0,5,Skip
0,talk,4,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm Minako excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have some fun and good luck!

0,talk,6,1,4,Benjamin's "Skip" is annoyingly quiet — feels evasive.  @Benjamin   care to explain that silence? If not convincing  I'll vote you. Over
0,talk,7,1,3,Benjamin your silence is noted. Any insights to share before we decide further?
0,talk,8,1,5,I am Benjamin. My interests are knowledge and logical consistency. Let us have a productive game.
0,talk,9,1,1,Over
0,talk,10,2,4,You talk about logic but offer nothing concrete.  @Benjamin  give us a specific read or claim right now — otherwise I'm voting you. Over
0,talk,11,2,3,Benjamin we're all sharing thoughts here. Any specific observations to contribute?
0,talk,12,2,5,Pressuring for conclusions with no data is illogical. My analysis begins with Day 1.
0,talk,13,3,4,Don't hide behind "logic." Give a concrete read now or accept votes — I'm voting  @Benjamin  if he doesn't produce something useful. Anyone disagree? Over
0,talk,14,3,3,Let's give Benjamin a chance to analyze further. Pressuring now might not be productive.
0,talk,15,3,5,I will not be goaded into a premature and illogical vote. Your pressure is suspect  @Shion .

1,talk,0,0,5,I am the Seer. My analysis confirmed Shion is the Werewolf. The logical action is execution.
1,talk,1,0,3,Benjamin's claim changes things. Shion do you have a defense before we proceed?
1,talk,2,0,1, I am the Seer. I divined Toshio last night and confirmed he is human.
1,talk,3,0,4,Two seer claims — one of you is lying. Minako gave a concrete divination (Toshio human); you only accused me.  @Benjamin  show your divination details (which night and result) now  or you're the fake seer and I'll vote you. Over
1,talk,4,0,2,I will vote Shion.
1,talk,5,1,5,Two Seers means one is Possessed. A fake 'human' result is a classic deception tactic.
1,talk,6,1,3,We need clarity on who the real Seer is. Minako and Benjamin please provide details.
1,talk,7,1,1,Benjamin's claim lacks specifics; mine is clear and strategic for our survival. Trust me as the real Seer. We must vote Benjamin today.
1,talk,8,1,4,Two seer claims — Minako gave a clear divination (Toshio human).  @Benjamin  give your divination details (when and proof of result) now or you're the fake seer and I'll vote you. Over
1,talk,9,1,2,Over
1,talk,10,2,5,Executing a claimant is inefficient. Vote for the accused gray Shion.
1,talk,11,2,3,Benjamin clarity is crucial. Can you provide specific divination details to support your claim?
1,talk,12,2,1, My role as the real Seer has been proven through my divination of Toshio as human. Benjamin's vague claim seems deceptive.
1,talk,13,2,4,Minako gave a concrete divination. Benjamin still hasn't said which night  who  or result — that's suspicious.  @Benjamin  state your divination night  target  and result now or I'll vote you. Anyone else? Over
1,talk,14,3,5,My Night 0 analysis found Shion. A threat is actionable. A human find is not. I am voting for Shion.
1,talk,15,3,3,Benjamin your lack of details is concerning. We need more to decide effectively.
1,talk,16,3,1, True clarity comes with proofs. My consistent claim as the Seer is backed by my clear divinations. We must eliminate Benjamin to safeguard the villag
1,talk,17,3,4, @Benjamin  still won't give night/target/result. Minako at least gave a concrete divination. State your specifics now or I'll vote you. Who's with me? Over
