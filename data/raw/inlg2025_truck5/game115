1,talk,0,0,4,I will vote Toshio.
1,talk,1,0,1,Sakura why do you suspect Toshio? Let's discuss it together before deciding.
1,talk,2,0,5, @Asuka  your divination result is the crucial variable. Let us begin our analysis there.
1,talk,3,0,2,I am the Seer. I divined Ms. Rin as Werewolf. Let's consider the facts. We must remain composed in our voting my friends.
1,talk,4,0,3,I am the true Seer. Last night I divined: Rin is Werewolf. Multiple Seer claims imply one is lying. @Minako  you cannot be Seer since I hold that role and my divination proves Rin is Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,4,Over
1,talk,6,1,1,Minako why are you claiming Seer? We need to resolve this confusion quickly!
1,talk,7,1,5,A Seer and a Possessed have claimed. Their identical divination for Rin makes her the logical target.
1,talk,8,1,2,Mr. Asuka your bold Seer claim stands with mine. Let's consider the facts. Unified divination will guide today's vote.
1,talk,9,1,3,Rin is a Werewolf per my divination. Minako repeats my claim showing the Possessed. Let's vote based on reason. @Toshio  your analysis fits. Coordinated action on Rin is the most rational move.
1,talk,10,2,1,Guys I'm not a Werewolf! Let's find who’s lying about being the Seer first.
1,talk,11,2,5,Both claimants identify Rin. This is our clearest data. I will vote for Rin.
1,talk,12,2,2,Let's consider the facts. I have divined Mr. Rin as a Werewolf. Consistency hints Ms. Asuka may be Possessed. We must remain composed.
1,talk,13,2,3,Duplicated seer claims and matching results make Rin the lynch. Emotional appeals don't convince me. @Rin  appealing to emotion doesn't counter my objective divination. You are the Werewolf by clear evidence.
1,talk,14,3,1,Please let's be careful. If we vote wrong the real Werewolf and Possessed win.
1,talk,15,3,5,The two claims pointing to Rin are our most logical foundation. My vote is for Rin.
1,talk,16,3,2,Let's consider the facts. My divination reveals Rin as Werewolf. Ignoring this is a risk. Villagers must remain composed in voting. @Rin Mr. or Ms. Dear friend. Let's consider the facts. Your lack of prior divination raises legitimate suspicions. Remain composed.
1,talk,17,3,3,With Seer counterclaim and identical divination the chance of both being false is negligible. The logical vote is Rin. @Minako Your claim mirrors mine exactly which signals Possessed play. The facts leave no credible doubt: Rin is Werewolf.
