0,talk,9,1,1,Jonathan nice to meet you. Any thoughts on Daisuke's early claim as a villager?
0,talk,10,2,2, @Daisuke  Your instant villager claim feels off—why rush it? Explain what you did last night. Everyone else  any night actions or role claims to share now? If not

0,talk,12,2,1,Mizuki I agree. We need to discuss more before making any assumptions. Any thoughts Toshio?
0,talk,13,3,2,Everyone's being vague.  @Daisuke  You still haven't said what you did last night—be specific. If no one else has a role claim or action to share soon  I'm leaning toward voting you as a test

1,talk,0,0,1,Good morning everyone. Any new insights or thoughts on Daisuke's role claim?
1,talk,1,0,4,Good morning. I divined Mizuki last night and she is human. Let's focus on gathering more information today.
1,talk,2,0,2, @Toshio  You publicly divined me and said I'm human—why announce that so openly? If you're the real seer  explain your reasoning or other results; if not  this lo
1,talk,3,0,5,Order must be upheld. I am the Seer. Last night I divined Daisuke. He is a werewolf.
1,talk,4,0,3,I will vote George.
1,talk,5,1,1,Jonathan if you're the real Seer why did Toshio claim Mizuki as human?
1,talk,6,1,4,I urge everyone to vote for Jonathan. My reasoning is based on his conflicting divination.
1,talk,7,1,2, @Toshio  Explain exactly what you did last night and why you publicly announced divining me. That’s a strange play for a real seer—give details or you look fake
1,talk,8,1,5,Two seers have presented their testimony. Prudence dictates we judge an unconfirmed player today.
1,talk,9,1,3,I will vote George.
1,talk,10,2,1,Toshio your claim seems risky. Can you provide more context for your actions?
1,talk,11,2,4,I divined Mizuki as human and she is truthful. Jonathan claims to have divined Daisuke as werewolf which conflicts with the information and behavior
1,talk,12,2,2, @Toshio  Your public divination of me is suspicious—explain exactly what you did last night and why you targeted me. If you can't clarify  I'll vote for you. Any
1,talk,13,2,5,My divination revealed Daisuke's nature. Judgment upon him is the only logical course.
1,talk,14,2,3,I will vote George.
1,talk,15,3,1,Mizuki let's hear Toshio out. Can anyone else confirm or refute Jonathan's claim?
1,talk,16,3,4,Vote Jonathan today. His claim directly contradicts my divination result where I confirmed Mizuki as human.
1,talk,17,3,2, @Toshio  Explain exactly what you did last night and why you announced divining me. No clear answer and I’ll vote you. Anyone else with night info  speak now. Ove
