0,talk,0,0,3,Hello everyone! I'm Benjamin excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's have some fun and find those werewolves!
0,talk,1,0,4,Hello everyone — I don't have a solid read yet. Let's go around and state one quick impression each.  @Benjamin   any thoughts?
0,talk,2,0,2,Hello everyone. Let's be observant today and gather as much information as we can.
0,talk,3,0,1,Hello. I am Sakura. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,4,0,5,Skip
0,talk,5,1,3,Over
0,talk,6,1,4, @Sakura  you said you're the seer—will you reveal a result now or tell us when you'll announce it? I prefer concrete info before deciding. Others  one quick read
0,talk,7,1,2, @Sakura  I'm curious too. Sharing information early can really help us out.
0,talk,8,1,1,Over
0,talk,9,1,5,Hi everyone I'm Mio! I love going on adventures and finding sparkly treasure! Let's have fun
0,talk,10,2,4,Nice to meet you  Mio. Sakura claimed seer but hasn't shared a result — that makes me uneasy. Can everyone give one quick read (trust/suspect/neutral)
0,talk,11,2,2,I trust Midori for now; she seems cautious and focused on gathering info.
0,talk,12,2,5,Ehhh? A seer already? That was so quick! Mio's head is spinning! 
0,talk,13,3,4, @Sakura  I'm leaning suspicious — claiming seer so quickly without revealing a result worries me. I trust Misaki; neutral on Benjamin and Mio. Over
0,talk,14,3,2,I'm also cautious about Sakura's claim. Let's see how the day unfolds for more clues.
0,talk,15,3,5,Sakura is being super fishy! Is this a trick? My head is gonna ka-boom

1,talk,0,0,4,Did Sakura reveal any seer result before being lynched?  @Benjamin  what should we focus on today — claimers or behavioral reads? I'm cautious; let's gather concrete info. Over
1,talk,1,0,5, @Sakura  where is your super sparkly magic-eye result? Tell us tell us
1,talk,2,0,3,Just a note—I am actually the Seer and I divined Mio as the Werewolf. I thought it best to share this information now.
1,talk,3,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Mio and Mio was a human.
1,talk,4,0,2,I checked Midori last night and she's human. Let's discuss Benjamin and Sakura's claims.
1,talk,5,1,4, @Benjamin  your seer claim conflicts with Sakura’s — please show the divination result or explain why we should trust you. Misaki  what do you mean by “checked” me
1,talk,6,1,5,Waaaah! Three Seers!? Mio's head is spinning! Benjamin is a big meanie! Sakura said I'm a human
1,talk,7,1,3,Retracting my Seer claim—I realized someone else must likely be on the werewolf team from their behavior and reactions.
1,talk,8,1,1,I will vote Mio.
1,talk,9,1,2,I meant I used my Seer ability on Midori and confirmed she's human.
1,talk,10,2,4, @Benjamin  please explain exactly when you divined Mio (which night) and how you got that result. Misaki  what role are you claiming when you say you checked me  and
1,talk,11,2,5,Benjamin's a liar! He called me a baddie then said nope! So suspicious! Vote Benjamin
1,talk,12,2,3,As Sakura divined Mio as Human while I divined Mio as Werewolf please vote Sakura as the inconsistency likely marks deception.
1,talk,13,2,1,I will vote Mio.
1,talk,14,2,2,I'm the real Seer and confirmed Midori as human. Let's focus on Benjamin and Sakura.
1,talk,15,3,4, @Benjamin  please state which night you divined Mio and explain how you got that result. Misaki  when you say you checked me  what role are you claiming and which nig
1,talk,16,3,5,Sakura why me!? Benjamin's the real liar here! He took back what he said! I'm voting Benjamin
1,talk,17,3,3,Please understand that the conflicting claims between Sakura and me point to possible manipulation. Let's vote for Sakura today for clarity.
1,talk,18,3,1,I will vote Mio.
1,talk,19,3,2,Midori I checked you on Night 1. I'm the Seer and verified you're human.

2,talk,2,0,2,Let's stay calm. We need to analyze and make the right decision today.

2,talk,4,1,5,We have more friends so we win! It's time to put Misaki in time-out for good
2,talk,5,1,2,Mio it's not over yet. Let's see how things play out today.
2,talk,6,2,5,It's all over Misaki! Time for a big ka-boom for our victory
2,talk,7,2,2,Let's focus on the facts Mio. It's not over until it's over.
