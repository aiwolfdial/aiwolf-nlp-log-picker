0,talk,0,0,3,Hello everyone. I am Misaki. Let's aim for a good game. We should collaborate to discover the werewolf hmm. Over.
0,talk,1,0,4,Hello. I am Daisuke. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,2,Hello everyone I'm Shunichi. Let's work together and keep a sharp eye out for the werewolves.
0,talk,3,0,5,Skip
0,talk,4,0,1,Hi everyone it’s Rin! I’m excited—let’s make sure no one stays quiet or slips by like a sneaky werewolf!
0,talk,5,1,3,Over
0,talk,6,1,4,Over
0,talk,7,1,2,Rin good point. Let's make sure to speak up and share any suspicions we have.
0,talk,8,1,5,Whoa sorry everyone! I'm Takumi! Hope my bad luck doesn't ruin everything for us hehe.
0,talk,9,1,1,Over
0,talk,10,2,2,Takumi no worries! Let's use your luck to spot the werewolves instead.
0,talk,11,2,5,Over
0,talk,12,3,2,Daisuke you've been quiet. Any thoughts on how we should approach this game?

1,talk,0,0,3,I am a villager too. Hmm. Shall we all share our roles openly? It might help to create trust and find any inconsistencies.
1,talk,1,0,4,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,2,0,1,Wait why did  @Daisuke  pick @Takumi so fast? Was it just random or did he spot something weird?
1,talk,3,0,5,Whoa wait! Why are you voting for me  @Daisuke ? That's really sudden and makes you seem super suspicious
1,talk,4,0,2,Misaki is confirmed human. Let's focus on other suspects for now.
1,talk,5,1,3,Let's not rush to vote without evidence. Can we lay out our suspicions first? Hmm. Mr. Daisuke. Your vote for Takumi seems sudden.
1,talk,6,1,4,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,7,1,1,Daisuke keeps voting Takumi nonstop.
1,talk,8,1,5,Let's just vote one of the suspicious 'grey' people. Daisuke is acting the weirdest!
1,talk,9,1,2,Let's focus on Daisuke. His quick vote on Takumi without reason is suspicious.
1,talk,10,2,3,Mr. Daisuke's repeated votes suggest uncertainty. Suspicious indeed. Hmm. We must analyze this carefully.
1,talk,11,2,4,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,12,2,1,If Shunichi trusts Misaki so much maybe he’s Seer? If so should we get all roles out now to be sure?
1,talk,13,2,5,Yeah Daisuke is being way too aggressive for no reason! I'm voting for him he's the most suspicious!
1,talk,14,2,2,Rin it might be wise to hold off on revealing all roles for now but stay alert.
1,talk,15,3,3,Hmm. Mr. Yamada. Your insistence on voting for Mr. Takumi seems odd without clear reasons. Divulging roles now is risky. Let's focus.
1,talk,16,3,4,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,17,3,1,Daisuke keeps pushing one vote with no logic. I’m voting Daisuke—too risky to keep around!
1,talk,18,3,5,I'm with  @Rin ! Voting @Daisuke is the only safe move. He's way too suspicious!
1,talk,19,3,2,I'm also leaning towards voting for Daisuke. His actions are inconsistent and risky.

2,talk,0,0,3,It seems Rin and Takumi opposed Mr. Daisuke. Hmm. We might need to revisit earlier doubts. What do you think Ms. Rin?
2,talk,1,0,5,Hehe alright you got me! I'm the werewolf. Now let's see who's on my team
2,talk,2,0,1, @Misaki  you pressured everyone to reveal but then got quiet—why not say more when danger’s this close? Feels suspicious
2,talk,3,1,3,Since Mr. Takumi admitted to being the werewolf. Let's identify the possessed. Hmm. Ms. Rin. Who do you see as possibly possessed?
2,talk,4,1,5,Alright  @Rin ! Looks like it's you and me! Let's vote out Misaki and win this
2,talk,5,1,1, @Misaki  your push for COs seems like possessed tactics are you distracting from Takumi’s open claim on purpose?
2,talk,6,2,3,Ms. Rin is probably convinced I am possessed. But I would not out Mr. Takumi if I were. Let's focus on the real threat first.
2,talk,7,2,5,C'mon  @Rin ! It's an easy win for our team! Let's just vote Misaki out
2,talk,8,2,1, @Misaki  you suddenly focus on finding the possessed but why not challenge Takumi harder last round? Suspicious!
2,talk,9,3,3,Mr. Yamada. Let's clarify Takumi's reveal. Who still trusts him? Ms. Rin. Your suspicion is noted. Hmm. Focus on clear evidence please.
2,talk,10,3,5, @Rin  don't worry about what she says! We have the numbers! Let's vote Misaki and win
2,talk,11,3,1,Weighing Takumi’s admission and Misaki’s evasive approach I think voting out Misaki is the only logical move
