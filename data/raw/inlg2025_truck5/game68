0,talk,0,0,1,Hi everyone! I’m Yumi super excited to play with you all. Let’s have lots of fun and figure things out together!
0,talk,1,0,3,Hello everyone I'm Minako. Let's work together to find the werewolves.
0,talk,2,0,2,Greetings everyone. I am Shion and eager to engage in this game of deduction. Isn't that interesting? Let us proceed with sharp minds.
0,talk,3,0,4,Hi! I'm Rin.  @Minako   you seemed to change your story and that makes me nervous — can you explain? If no good answer  I want to vote for you. Anyone have a role or divination to sh

0,talk,9,1,5,I am Shunichi. I will be observing.
0,talk,10,2,3,Rin I simply introduced myself and suggested we work together to find the werewolves.
0,talk,11,2,4,That still doesn't explain it   @Minako  — you were really quiet at first  then suddenly defended yourself. Which part actually stayed the same? If nobody explains  I'll vote for you. Any seer o
0,talk,12,2,5, @Rin  Your accusation lacks a basis in the provided logs. A futile line of inquiry.
0,talk,13,3,3,Rin I've been consistent in wanting us to collaborate. Let's focus on finding clues.
0,talk,14,3,4,That's not fair —  @Shunichi   please explain why my accusation has no basis. Do you have a reason to trust her? If no one explains  I'll vote for her today.
0,talk,15,3,5,The log contains no contradiction. Your accusation lacks a logical foundation.

1,talk,0,0,2,Let's give this a little thought shall we? Minako is indeed a werewolf! We must protect the village and consider casting our votes accordingly.
1,talk,1,0,1, @Shion  your accusation was super quick! Can you share what made you so sure about Minako being the wolf?
1,talk,2,0,4,Wow  @Shion  that was really quick—what made you so sure Minako is a werewolf? I'm still suspicious of Minako too since she was quiet then suddenly defended hersel
1,talk,3,0,5,A Seer claim has been made. If another exists speak now. Otherwise we have a clear target.
1,talk,4,0,3,I am the Seer and I checked Shion last night; he is human. Let's focus elsewhere.
1,talk,5,1,2,Minako's claim as a seer adds a layer of complexity. Isn't that interesting? I must adhere to my seer claim. Let's decide a target.
1,talk,6,1,1,If we choose the wrong Seer claimant we’re in trouble. Should we pressure both Minako and Shion for more details?
1,talk,7,1,4,That's a big claim!  @Shion  please tell us who you divined and what result you got. If you can't say  I'll ask the other seer claimant to explain. Over
1,talk,8,1,5,2CO. Seer and Possessed is the probable case. Executing a claimant is a waste. Scrutinize the unconfirmed.
1,talk,9,1,3,Shunichi is right; let's scrutinize those who haven't claimed. We need more info.
1,talk,10,2,2,Minako's claim misses the mark. I'm the real seer. My analysis hints Minako could be Possessed or a Werewolf. Shunichi isn't that interesting? You’r
1,talk,11,2,1,If both Seers could be real or one is madman maybe we should focus on the unclaimed like Shunichi or Rin for today.
1,talk,12,2,4,Hi I'm Rin!  @Shion  please tell us exactly who you divined and what result you got — we need proof before voting. If you can't show it  I'll probably vote for the quiet one fro
1,talk,13,2,5,Executing a claimant benefits the werewolf. The logical move is to vote unconfirmed. Rin your behavior is the most suspect.
1,talk,14,2,3,Focusing on the unconfirmed seems wise. Rin can you share more about your thoughts?
1,talk,15,3,2,Isn't Minako's seer claim fascinating? It seems like a classic move from those mischievous werewolves. Let's think carefully here.
1,talk,16,3,1,I’ve thought it over and think it’s too risky to target a Seer today. For safety I’ll vote Rin. Everyone okay with that?
1,talk,17,3,4,Still waiting   @Shion  — who did you divine and what was the result? If you can't say  I'll vote for Minako. Over
1,talk,18,3,5,Executing a claimant is a tactical error. The most disruptive variable to eliminate is Rin.
1,talk,19,3,3,Yumi I agree. Targeting Rin today seems the safest option for us all.

2,talk,0,0,1,@Minako and  @Shion  one of you must be fake. Can each of you clearly restate your results and reasoning for us?
2,talk,1,0,3,I checked Yumi and found she is a werewolf. We should act on this information today.
2,talk,2,0,2,Yumi. Isn't that interesting? I divined Minako. She is Human. So her claim against you seems... worth questioning. Let's give this a little thought.
2,talk,3,1,1, @Minako  your results keep changing. Looks like classic possessed tactics. I trust Shion’s claim over yours.
2,talk,4,1,3,Yumi my results are consistent. Shion's claim contradicts reality; you're the werewolf.
2,talk,5,1,2,Isn't that interesting? Minako claims Yumi is a werewolf but I divined Minako is Human. Thus it seems Yumi is the likely werewolf.
2,talk,6,2,1, @Shion  Minako’s sudden claim today feels desperate. I trust your Seer results more than hers right now.
2,talk,7,2,3,Yumi denying my results won’t change the truth. We should focus on eliminating threats.
2,talk,8,2,2, @Minako  Isn't that interesting? I divined Yumi and my findings suggest she is not the Werewolf. Can you offer your reasoning on this?
2,talk,9,3,1, @Shion  Minako’s switch to accuse me now feels desperate. I’m voting for Minako because her story keeps shifting.
2,talk,10,3,3,Shion my reasoning is based on my findings. We need to act on the werewolf threat.
2,talk,11,3,2,Let's give this a little thought shall we? Minako's abrupt switch toward Yumi appears rather desperate. Isn't that interesting?
