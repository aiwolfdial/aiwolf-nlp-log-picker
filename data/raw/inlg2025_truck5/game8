0,talk,0,0,4,Morning. I'll sit back for now — no claim. Let's hear role claims and reads before we rush to lynch.  @Mizuki   what's your current read?
0,talk,1,0,5,Hey everyone! It's awesome to see you all here! I'm Yumi. How's it going today? Just feeling things out before any big choices!
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm Servas excited to join you all for a game of Werewolf. Let's have some fun together!
0,talk,3,0,3,Hi everyone! I'm Mio. Let's share thoughts and work together to catch the werewolves!
0,talk,4,0,2,Hi everyone I’m Mizuki. Looking forward to a logical discussion and fair play. Let’s observe closely and enjoy the game.
0,talk,5,1,4,Morning. I have no claim—let's not rush a Day‑1 lynch.  @Mizuki  who do you find suspicious so far? Others  give quick reads or any role claims.
0,talk,6,1,5,Over
0,talk,7,1,1,Over
0,talk,8,1,3,I'm curious to hear from Yumi and Servas too. Any thoughts on who seems suspicious?
0,talk,9,1,2,Over
0,talk,10,2,4,I'm leaning to lynch  @Mizuki  — their one‑word replies feel evasive. Any last reads or objections before we vote?
0,talk,11,2,3,Let's hear from Mizuki before deciding. Any thoughts Mizuki?
0,talk,12,3,4,I agree —  @Mizuki 's one‑word replies are suspicious. If they don't explain now  I'm voting to lynch. Any solid defense?
0,talk,13,3,3,Let's give Mizuki a moment to respond. It's important to hear everyone's side.

1,talk,0,0,2,I’m the Seer I checked Mio last night and she is Human. @Yumi  @Servas  please share your thoughts Benjamin feels suspicious.
1,talk,1,0,3,Thanks Mizuki! Let's hear from Yumi and Servas. Benjamin any defense?
1,talk,2,0,5,Hey friends! Mizuki is our Seer and she divined Mio as human! That's awesome news! But Servas being quiet? Kinda strategic huh?
1,talk,3,0,1,I divined Yumi last night and she’s the Werewolf. We need to discuss this and act together to protect the village.
1,talk,4,0,4,Two conflicting divination claims — we can’t both have true seers.  @Servas  please clarify: what role are you claiming  when did you check Yumi  and how sure are you of that result? Mizuki  give the time you checked Mio. We need time
1,talk,5,1,2, @Mio  I checked you and you’re Human. Let’s work together—the two Seer claims can’t both be true. Who do you suspect most?
1,talk,6,1,3,With conflicting claims I'm leaning to trust Mizuki. Servas your claim seems off.
1,talk,7,1,5,Mizuki sure seems like the real Seer. We should keep an eye on Servas. Benjamin which Seer claim do you trust more? Mizuki's logic rocks!
1,talk,8,1,1, I'm the real Seer. I divined Yumi as a Werewolf confidently. Let's not fall for her diversion. We need to eliminate the threat to safeguard our village
1,talk,9,1,4,This is a serious contradiction — only one true seer.  @Servas  please state exactly when (which night) you divined Yumi and whether you were targeted/protected that night. Mizuki  also tell us when you checked Mi
1,talk,10,2,2,Servas and I can't both be Seer—I'm sure Mio is human. Let's vote Servas out and unite the village.
1,talk,11,2,3,Benjamin do you have any thoughts on who to trust? Mizuki seems genuine to me.
1,talk,12,2,5,Hey buddies! Since Mizuki divine Mio as human I totally trust her. But Servas's claim feels a bit fishy. Let's vote smartly!
1,talk,13,2,1, Trust my divination; I'm truly the Seer. Yumi is the Werewolf. Let's focus on removing the real threat here. Vote wisely to protect everyone.
1,talk,14,2,4,We have two incompatible seer claims with opposite results — we need specifics.  @Servas  please state exactly which night you divined Yumi  what role you're claiming  and whether you were targeted/protected that night. Mizuki  say which ni
1,talk,15,3,2,Servas’s claim came late and doesn’t match the facts. I’m voting Servas—please trust my proven result.
1,talk,16,3,3,I'm sticking with Mizuki. Servas your story doesn't add up. Let's make the right choice.
1,talk,17,3,5,Hey everyone! Mizuki's claim seems too convenient. What if Mizuki is leading us astray? Don't trust too quickly okay? @Mizuki Hey Mizuki. Your timing and claims are throwing me off. Are you really guiding us here pal or is there a trap waiting?
1,talk,18,3,1, My divination is legitimate—I divined Yumi as Werewolf the first night. I stand by my claim firmly. Let’s vote Yumi out for the village's safety.
1,talk,19,3,4,Morning. I have no claim — let's share any role claims and quick reads before we rush to lynch.  @Mizuki  what’s your read so far?

2,talk,0,0,4,Morning. Mizuki killed — likely a wolf. Servas lynched — was that the fake seer or a sacrificed villager?  @Mio   are you the seer? Please share your night result. Yumi  what's your read?
2,talk,1,0,5,Losing Mizuki was really tough. I totally trusted her claim. I think the wolf targeted her. How do you feel about Servas and Benjamin?
2,talk,2,0,3,I'm not the Seer but I trusted Mizuki. Benjamin do you have any insights?
2,talk,3,1,4,Morning. Mizuki was killed — likely a wolf. Servas was lynched after claiming seer and accusing Yumi  so that claim looks fake or one of them lied.  @Mio  please reveal if you’re the seer and who you checked last night. Yumi  why did you defend Mizuki earlier? We need clear info before voting.
2,talk,4,1,5,Now that Mizuki's gone and Servas got lynched our info might be skewed. Let's trust analytical vibes over claims now.  @Benjamin  hey buddy! Benjamin! I've been a little lost since Mizuki's gone. Since Servas claimed seer how do you view those claims now?
2,talk,5,1,3,I relied on Mizuki's insight before. Yumi what's your take on Benjamin now?
2,talk,6,2,4, @Mio  please reveal if you’re the seer and who you checked last night. Mizuki was killed — likely a wolf — and Servas’s seer claim conflicted with theirs. Yum
2,talk,7,2,5,Hey buddies! Tonight's divination needs some strategic picks. How about Benjamin or Mio? Do you think they can share even more with us?
2,talk,8,2,3,I think Benjamin's insights could be crucial. Let's hear what he has to say.
2,talk,9,3,4, @Mio  — are you the seer? If so  who did you check last night and what was the exact result (and when)? Yumi  what's your read/vote today?
2,talk,10,3,5,Hey buddy! Isn't it weird that Mio hasn't been divined yet? That's suspicious. If we trust her and lose she's misguiding us. Let's find out her role! @Mio Your reliance on Mizuki felt like a cover. Were you just playing along to divert us from suspecting you as a werewolf buddy?
2,talk,11,3,3,I'm not the Seer just a villager. Let's focus on finding the real werewolf together.
