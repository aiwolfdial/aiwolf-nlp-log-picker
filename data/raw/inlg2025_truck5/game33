0,talk,1,0,3,Hey everyone it’s Mio! I’m excited but nervous—let’s work together and solve this quick before I trip over myself!
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello team. I’m Jonathan. I see we’re ready for some mystery-solving fun. I look forward to finding clues together my friends.
0,talk,3,0,4,Hello everyone! I'm Victoria and I'm excited to play Werewolf with you all. Let's hope for a fun twisty game!
0,talk,4,0,2,Alright I'll say it straight—I'm a plain Villager. Nothing fancy just here to hunt wolves with grit. @Mio  don't worry about being nervous. Trust your gut and speak up! We're counting on each other.
0,talk,5,1,5,I'm Daisuke! Ready for adventure! I hope my bad luck doesn't cause any trouble

1,talk,0,0,2,Seer speak up already if you have any results. We need info to catch the wolf and protect each other. Let's get to it! @Victoria  you sounded excited yesterday. Is that confidence or something else? Got any suspicions to share?
1,talk,1,0,5,I'm the Seer! Last night I checked Takumi and he's the Werewolf! We gotta vote him out now
1,talk,2,0,4, Takumi is Human. I am actually the Seer and my divination last night confirmed it. We need to correct this information.
1,talk,3,0,3, @Victoria  and @Daisuke both claim Seer and picked Takumi. Why did you each choose him for your first divination?
1,talk,4,0,1,I divined Takumi as Human last night. I see. There is another Seer claim. I assure you. Takumi isn't the Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,2,Three Seer claims all targeting me. Someone's lying—let's figure out who it is! @Daisuke  you called me the Werewolf. Why target me on night one? What's your reasoning?
1,talk,6,1,5,Three Seers?! That means there's a real one a possessed one and a werewolf here! And I found him
1,talk,7,1,4,Vote for Jonathan. His claim as Seer contradicts my accurate vision of Takumi being human. He's likely either the Possessed or the Werewolf.
1,talk,8,1,3,Daisuke you’re the only one saying Takumi is a wolf. Isn’t that risky? I’m leaning suspicious of you right now.
1,talk,9,1,1,I see. I suggest divining Daisuke tonight. Two conflicting claims made already dear friend. We must clarify his role.
1,talk,10,2,2,I'm a Villager and these multiple Seer claims are a mess. Victoria and Jonathan agree Daisuke stands alone—feels off. @Mio  your suspicion of Daisuke tracks with the facts. We need to stand firm find the real liar and push for clarity.
1,talk,11,2,5,Two people protecting Takumi is way too suspicious! I'm sure he's the wolf! We gotta vote for Takumi
1,talk,12,2,4,Jonathan's insistence on a contradictory divination suggests manipulation. His eagerness to target others seems like a strategy to sow confusion
1,talk,13,2,3,Daisuke is the only one calling Takumi a werewolf. With two others saying human I think we should vote out Daisuke.
1,talk,14,2,1,I see. Two claim he's human. Yet Daisuke calls him wolf. Odd indeed.  @Victoria  Daisuke seems off. What's your thought dear Victoria?
1,talk,15,3,2,It's time to act! Three Seer claims but Daisuke is the only one calling me a wolf. My vote goes to Daisuke—enough games! @Jonathan  you're smart and seem serious about this. Are you ready to stand with me and vote Daisuke out? Let's be bold!
1,talk,16,3,5,No don't vote for me! That's a huge mistake! Victoria and Jonathan are teaming up to protect Takumi
1,talk,17,3,4,Jonathan's claim that he divined Takumi as human contradicts his suggestion of targeting Daisuke next. It doesn't logically follow if he truly beli
1,talk,18,3,3,Three Seers but only Daisuke calls Takumi a wolf. I’m voting Daisuke so we stay united and don’t risk a split.
1,talk,19,3,1,I see. Sticking with Daisuke risks chaos. Wolves may win. Our resolve must be bold. We must protect the village.

2,talk,0,0,2,Daisuke flipped yesterday and Jonathan's gone. That means we lost a Seer but let's keep things straight and sharp today. @Victoria  your claim matches what Jonathan said so right now I trust you most. Any new reads you can share?
2,talk,1,0,3, @Victoria  if you’re really the Seer who would you divine tonight and why? I want a clear answer before I decide my vote.
2,talk,2,0,4, My divination revealed Takumi as a Werewolf. Mio please vote Takumi today. It's crucial for our survival.
2,talk,3,1,2,That is a total reversal from yesterday Victoria. Yesterday I was Human today I'm a Werewolf? Make that make sense! @Victoria  your logic's a mess. Why would your result switch like that? This flip proves you’re the liar not me.
2,talk,4,1,3, @Victoria  your story broke—why did Takumi go from Human to Wolf? This flip makes you look like the werewolf now.
2,talk,5,1,4,I made an error yesterday. My accurate divination showed Takumi as the Werewolf. Mio we need to vote for Takumi today.
2,talk,6,2,2,Everyone let's get serious. Victoria is cornered—her "mistake" is just a cover-up. Stick with the facts and don't waver! @Mio  you see it too. Victoria is caught in her own lie. We’re the honest ones here—let’s push her out strong!
2,talk,7,2,3,Switching results isn’t a Seer power  @Victoria . Why did your story change? It looks like classic wolf tactics to me.
2,talk,8,2,4, I am the real Seer and my first claim yesterday was false to test reactions. Today I'm being honest: Takumi is the Werewolf. Vote him out.
2,talk,9,3,2,Victoria’s tactic is reckless. I’m a plain Villager and I won’t let her twist the truth! @Victoria  if you lied before why trust today’s claim? That’s not brave—it’s just desperate.
2,talk,10,3,3,Victoria’s Seer flip doesn’t add up—I’m convinced she’s the wolf. I’m voting Victoria to protect the village.
2,talk,11,3,4, I understand the confusion about my previous statement. Voting for Takumi is vital; he is the Werewolf. Please reconsider Mio.
