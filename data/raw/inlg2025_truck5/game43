0,talk,0,0,4,If I may. Greetings to all present. I am Jonathan. Let's ensure a cooperative and enjoyable game as we work to uncover the Werewolf. Over.
0,talk,1,0,2,Hi everyone! Let's have fun and find those Werewolves together! Any thoughts on strategy?
0,talk,2,0,3,I am Victoria. A pleasure to participate.
0,talk,3,0,5,Don't rush to lynch on vibes. Day 0 talk is noisy.  @Jonathan  — you opened nicely  but do you have any reads or reasons to watch someone? Any role claims? I'll watch for now. Over
0,talk,4,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm Minato excited to find out who's hiding as the werewolf. Let's enjoy the game!

0,talk,6,1,2,Shion any hunches or strategies you suggest? Let's catch those Werewolves!

0,talk,8,1,5,No lynch Day0. Quick plan: everyone posts a one-line self-read (who you trust/suspect and one reason) to force actual content.  @Jonathan  — start us off with your one-line read. Over

0,talk,10,2,2,I trust Minato for now; he seems genuinely eager to play. How about you Shion?
0,talk,11,2,5,One-line read: I suspect  @Jonathan  — he pushes the discussion but stays vague; I trust Minato for now since he's calm and cooperative. Over
0,talk,12,3,2,Victoria your thoughts? Who do you trust or suspect so far?
0,talk,13,3,5,Victoria  what's your one-line read? I'm still leaning suspicious of  @Jonathan  — opens smoothly but stays vague; trusting Minato and Sakura for now. Over

1,talk,0,0,3,The subject with the investigative function should present their report. This data is critical.
1,talk,1,0,4,If I may I suggest the seer reveal themselves. This way we can protect them and then focus on finding the werewolf together.
1,talk,2,0,1,No reveal from the seer yet; it might risk them too early. Let's share more of our thoughts on trust and suspicion first.
1,talk,3,0,2,I checked Shion last night and he's a werewolf! We need to act quickly!
1,talk,4,0,5,Bold claim  Sakura. How exactly did you check me? No prior reads or build-up — feels rushed. If you really inspected me  give specifics or reveal now. Mea @Jonathan 's push for the seer to reveal smells like a setup — why pressure them so hard this early? Over
1,talk,5,1,3,We have a singular seer claim. In the absence of conflicting data we must act upon it.
1,talk,6,1,4,If I may. Sakura's claim is crucial. If her words hold truth we ought to focus on Ms. Shion. Otherwise Sakura might be key.
1,talk,7,1,1,Everyone let's vote for Shion based on Sakura's divination revealing him as the werewolf. This information is critical for our strategy.
1,talk,8,1,2,I used my seer ability to check Shion and it confirmed he's a werewolf. Let's trust it!
1,talk,9,1,5, @Sakura  Your claim has zero supporting detail — when exactly did you check me and how certain are you? No build-up  no prior reads  just a sudden bomb. Smells like
1,talk,10,2,3,We have one investigative report and no counter-claim. Eliminating Shion is the logical next step.
1,talk,11,2,4,If I may perhaps the seer should divine Mr. Minato tonight. They've been engaged yet aligning with consensus too swiftly.
1,talk,12,2,1,Look at the evidence we have. Sakura divined Shion as the werewolf. There's no counter-claim or other seer report making Shion highly suspect. We sho
1,talk,13,2,2,I checked Shion last night using my seer ability and it confirmed he's a werewolf.
1,talk,14,2,5, @Sakura  — big claim. State the night (which night you checked me) and the exact result format (e.g. “Night1 inspected Shion → werewolf”). No specifics = suspi
1,talk,15,3,3,The Werewolf's optimal outcome is our paralysis. Let us proceed with the experiment and test this claim.
1,talk,16,3,4,If I may Ms. Shion. While Sakura's claim carries weight your stance hints at more than mere denial. Any shared insights perhaps?
1,talk,17,3,1, Sakura's clear seer claim designates Shion as a werewolf. Not countering effectively raises our chances of targeting correctly. Let's vote for Shi
1,talk,18,3,2,Night 0: Inspected Shion. Result: Werewolf. Let's act and vote accordingly!
1,talk,19,3,5, @Sakura  — you claimed to inspect me. State the exact night and the exact result format (e.g. “Night1: Sakura inspected Shion → werewolf”). No vague “I checked
