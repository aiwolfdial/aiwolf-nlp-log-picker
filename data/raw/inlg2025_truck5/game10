0,talk,1,0,5,Hello. I am Kenji. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,2,Kenji  a seer claim is important.  @Kenji  please tell us who you checked (or will check) and any result you have. I'm old and cautious — I’m watching George closely. Others  please share your ear

1,talk,0,0,3, @Minako  you haven’t given any reads yet. Hiding isn’t teamwork can you tell us your current suspects?
1,talk,1,0,1,Mr. Kenji is our declared seer. It is essential to listen to him. Mr. George's silence concerns me as well. Let us proceed carefully.

1,talk,3,0,4,Good morning everyone! Let's stay alert and work together to find those werewolves!
1,talk,4,0,5,I am a seer. I divined Minako and Minako was a human.
1,talk,5,1,3, @Kenji  you picked Minako for your first check. Why not Servas who was the loudest about suspicion?
1,talk,6,1,1,Kenji thank you. So I am confirmed human. Trust in my honesty. George seemed defensive. Let us consider their intent.  @George  Kenji's divination confirmed I am human. Do you have any insights on roles now?
1,talk,7,1,2,Thank you  Kenji.  @Kenji  please check George tonight — his defensiveness worries me. George  can you explain why you were so terse earlier? Minako is confirmed human  so let’s f
1,talk,8,1,4,Thanks for confirming Minako Kenji! Let's keep gathering info and stay positive!
1,talk,9,1,5,I will vote George.
1,talk,10,2,3, @Servas  you’re fixated on me with zero evidence. That’s just what a Possessed would do to throw us off.
1,talk,11,2,1,George please share your reasoning. Servas is proactively guiding. Let us remain calm and logical in our deductions.
1,talk,12,2,2, @Kenji  please check George tonight — his behavior still feels odd to me. George  could you explain your early silence? Minako and Yumi  any quick reads or votes
1,talk,13,2,4,George seems a bit defensive but let's keep an open mind and gather more info!
1,talk,14,2,5,I will vote George.
1,talk,15,3,3,Servas pushes too hard and rushes judgment like a wolf. That’s dangerous. I’ll vote Servas today.
1,talk,16,3,1,Kenji's choice indicates thoughtfulness. Yet my concern is George's defensiveness. Voting for Servas may be the wiser path.  @Yumi  Please share your view on Servas or George. Our dialogue can illuminate the direction we should take.
1,talk,17,3,2,Good morning. Any night news?  @Kenji  please tell us your divination result. George has been quiet and defensive — could you explain yourself? Minako  Yumi — quick reads  please. I don't wan
1,talk,18,3,4,I feel unsure about George's defensiveness but let's weigh options carefully!

2,talk,0,0,3, @Servas  your rush to vote and aggressive push feels more like Possessed than Villager. Why target me so hard?
2,talk,1,0,2,This is regrettable — we must be careful now.  @Kenji  please tell us your divination from last night: who did you check and what was the result? George  your earlier quietness still worries me — can you expl
2,talk,2,0,4,Let's be cautious and supportive today. Kenji your insights are crucial now!
2,talk,3,0,5,I am a seer. I divined Yumi and Yumi was a human.
2,talk,4,1,3,Kenji’s push for Minako’s vote out despite his own divination worries me.  @Servas  shouldn’t we question his certainty?

2,talk,6,1,4,I'm glad to be confirmed human! Let's focus on finding the werewolves together!
2,talk,7,1,5,I will vote George.
2,talk,8,2,3,Kenji’s voting Minako right after calling her Human makes no sense for a true Seer. That doesn’t add up.
2,talk,9,2,2,The loss of Minako pains me.  @Kenji  please share your latest divination result — we need clarity now. George  your earlier silence and defensiveness still worry me; can you explain? Yum
2,talk,10,2,4,Kenji your actions are confusing. Let's clarify and make wise decisions today!
2,talk,11,2,5,I will vote Yumi.
2,talk,12,3,3, @Yumi  both Kenji and Servas target me quickly. Servas feels too forceful to trust. My vote goes to Servas.
2,talk,13,3,2,This loss weighs on me.  @Kenji  please share your latest divination result — we need clarity. George  your early silence still troubles me; could you explain your behavior? Yumi  any
2,talk,14,3,4,Let's stay calm and think through this together. We need to make the right choice!
