1,talk,0,0,4,I divined Minako last night—result: Werewolf. That's right folks sparks are flying already! Shall we discuss? @Minako  any words about being under my 'Seer gaze'? The village is eager to hear your dazzling defense!
1,talk,1,0,3,I've also got something crucial to share. I divined Ryuji last night and the result was Werewolf. This is critical information!
1,talk,2,0,1,May I assure you I'm a Villager. Let's discuss both results carefully.
1,talk,3,0,2,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,4,0,5,My investigation revealed Jonathan was a Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,4,Well well it seems everyone woke up with a vision last night! Triple Seer showdown? Now that's my kind of breakfast drama. @Jonathan  bold move claiming Seer! Show us your charm—why should we believe your vision over mine or Ryuji's? Convince us.
1,talk,6,1,3,I can guarantee that I'm the true Seer. Trust me when I say I divined Ryuji with absolute certainty. He is definitely the Werewolf. We need to join force
1,talk,7,1,1,It's crucial we evaluate why each Seer claim targets different people. Let's remain calm.

1,talk,9,1,5,@Daisuke  @Minako  You are villagers. The 3 claimants are Seer Wolf Possessed. Jonathan is the wolf.
1,talk,10,2,4,Minako your poise is admirable but someone here is spinning tales! Let's not let charm distract us from deduction. @Ryuji  keen deductions but you're quick to label. Mind telling us why you're so confident Jonathan's the wolf?
1,talk,11,2,3, May and Ryuji are clearly trying to deflect attention from their suspicious activity. Focus on the evidence I provided. We need to vote out the real th
1,talk,12,2,1,Let's focus on any inconsistencies in stories and identify the true Seer. Stay calm.
1,talk,13,2,5, @Daisuke  your vote is illogical. The only logical test is to execute Jonathan.
1,talk,14,3,4,The triple Seer tangle is juicier than village gossip! Let's weigh these accusations—false prophets anyone? @Daisuke  locked in on Ryuji already? Care to share what makes you so sure while chaos reigns around us?
1,talk,15,3,3, I understand the confusion but I assure you I am the Seer. Ryuji is the Werewolf and we must act on this information.
1,talk,16,3,1,Let's stay logical and examine the reasoning behind each claim. Discussion is key.
1,talk,17,3,5,The 3CO scenario confirms roles. Daisuke and Minako are Villagers. Jonathan is the Werewolf. Vote for him.
