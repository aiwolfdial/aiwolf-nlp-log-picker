0,talk,0,0,4,Hello everyone let's work together to uncover any suspicious activity today.
0,talk,1,0,1,Hello everyone! I'm May excited to join this game and meet you all. Let's have some fun!

0,talk,3,0,2,Greetings friends—Servas here hopeful that we approach this night with patience and steady hearts.
0,talk,4,0,3,Hi everyone! I'm Rin. I don't like how  @George  sounded — too smooth and vague. Who else feels suspicious of him? I think we should keep an eye on George today. Over
0,talk,5,1,4,Rin I assure you my intentions are good. Let's focus on gathering more information.

0,talk,7,1,5,I am Victoria. I find observing group dynamics a fascinating experiment.

0,talk,9,1,3,I still think George sounded weird...  @May  do you have any reads or who are you thinking of voting for? I'm nervous — who else noticed odd behavior? Over
0,talk,10,2,4,Let's remain calm Rin. Observing behavior might reveal more as the day progresses.

0,talk,12,2,3, @May  do you have any reads or a divination result? I'm still worried about George — he seemed too calm earlier. Who should we vote for if we have to pick someon
0,talk,13,3,4,Rin it's wise to keep an open mind. Let's hear May's thoughts before deciding.
0,talk,14,3,3,I'm Rin.  @May  do you have any reads or a divination result? I'm really worried about George—he seemed too calm. If nobody has info  can we vote for George today? I'm ne

1,talk,0,0,4,Morning everyone. Let's share any insights we gathered and move forward wisely.
1,talk,1,0,3,Good morning! Did anyone die last night?  @May  please tell us your divination result — I'm still worried about George. If no info  can we vote for him today? Over
1,talk,2,0,1, Good morning! I divined Victoria last night and she is human. Let's focus on other suspects now.
1,talk,3,0,2,With Victoria confirmed by May let's focus on others.  @George  who do you suspect most among us now?
1,talk,4,0,5,I am the Seer. My investigation concluded George is the Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,4,Victoria I question your claim. Let's hear others before making rash decisions.
1,talk,6,1,3,Two people claim to be the Seer — that's scary.  @Victoria  you said George is the werewolf; can you explain how you found that? May says she divined you. Who's lying? We need to decide who to vote for soon. Over
1,talk,7,1,1, I must clarify — I am the real Seer. Victoria claiming to be the Seer is suspicious since I divined her as human. We must vote Victoria to protect the vill
1,talk,8,1,2, @May  and @Victoria what is your plan for night two divination? Whose vote out today would help us most?
1,talk,9,1,5,May is correct I am human. This makes my claim more credible. George is the werewolf. Vote him.
1,talk,10,2,4,Let's not rush. We need more evidence before deciding. Servas what do you think?
1,talk,11,2,3, @May  can you confirm when you divined Victoria and if you're sure? Two seer claims confuse me. If you're certain  I think we should vote Victoria. Over
1,talk,12,2,1, I divined Victoria last night and she is indeed human. Victoria falsely claiming to be the Seer is highly suspicious and a risk to us. I am the true Seer.
1,talk,13,2,2,Victoria’s claim conflicts; if May is truthful  Victoria must be lying. We should focus our vote on Victoria today.
1,talk,14,2,5,Consider the opposition's perspective. Excising a subject confirmed as human is their ideal outcome.
1,talk,15,3,4,This is a complex situation. Let's carefully consider our options before voting.
1,talk,16,3,3,Two seers is scary!  @Victoria  please tell us when and how you checked George and what you saw. If you can't explain it clearly  I'll vote for Victoria. Over
1,talk,17,3,1,  Trust me I am the real Seer. Victoria's claim is strategic to cause confusion. Voting for her will confirm this and protect the village.
1,talk,18,3,2,I find May’s claim more believable based on her timing and detail. I will vote Victoria—let’s stand together  friends.
1,talk,19,3,5,Your logic leads to your defeat. Excising a human benefits the opposition. George is the only suspect.

2,talk,0,0,1,Servas let's vote for George. My divination shows he is a werewolf. We need to eliminate him to win.
2,talk,1,0,4,We need to stay calm and think clearly. Servas what's your take now?
2,talk,2,0,2, @George  who do you suspect as the werewolf right now? We need answers not just questions at this stage.
2,talk,3,1,1, Servas my divination is clear and I need your support. George acted unnaturally calm when scrutinized which aligns suspiciously with my findings. L
2,talk,4,1,4,I'm unsure but May's insistence raises doubts. Let's tread carefully.
2,talk,5,1,2, @George  May’s divination shows you as wolf. If you’re innocent defend yourself clearly before we vote.
2,talk,6,2,1, Remember I've revealed George as the werewolf based on my divination. His defenses are merely distractions. Let's vote him out to protect our villag
2,talk,7,2,4,Servas I'm innocent. May's claim is strategic. Let's think carefully before voting.
2,talk,8,2,2, @George  if you're truly innocent then who do you think the wolf is and why? Speak plainly with your reasons.
2,talk,9,3,1,  As the Seer I urge you Servas to trust my insight. George is the werewolf and my results are steadfast. Let’s secure the village tonight.
2,talk,10,3,4,I'm not sure but May's certainty seems too calculated. Let's deliberate wisely.
2,talk,11,3,2,May’s results fit the facts so I’ll vote for George as the suspected wolf. Let’s protect our village.
