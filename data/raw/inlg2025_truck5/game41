0,talk,0,0,4,Let's stay sharp today everyone. Keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
0,talk,1,0,1,Greetings everyone. I am Asuka. I am eager to collaborate with you today. Let us enjoy the game together. Over.
0,talk,2,0,2,Hi everyone I’m Yumi! I hope we can have a friendly and fun game—let’s all do our best and support each other!
0,talk,3,0,5,Um...  @Asuka   you seem really nice  but I still feel uneasy. Did you notice anyone acting strange last night? I don't want to make a mistake. Over
0,talk,4,0,3,Hello. I am Victoria. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,4,Minato it's too early to suspect. Let's gather more info before jumping to conclusions.

0,talk,8,1,5,Shunichi's right. It's early — let's watch how everyone acts first.  @Asuka   did you notice anything last night or have any thoughts on who to watch? I get worried easily. Over

0,talk,10,2,4,Minato patience is key. Let's see who slips up first; overconfidence can be revealing.
0,talk,11,2,5,You're right  Shunichi. I'm nervous though... Maybe we can each say one small thing we noticed to help?  @Asuka  could you tell us if anything seemed strange to you last night  please? Over
0,talk,12,3,4,Let's focus on observations now not past events. Any hunches Asuka?
0,talk,13,3,5,Okay  let's each share one small observation now. I'm uneasy because everyone seems extra cheerful — maybe they're hiding something.  @Asuka  do you have any little hunch or thing that seemed off to you? Over

1,talk,0,0,1,Let me clarify. I divined Ms. Victoria. The divination result shows she is Human. She is undoubtedly on the villager's side.
1,talk,1,0,3,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,2,0,2, @Victoria  You voted me really fast—could you share your reason? Sudden votes can be risky for villagers.
1,talk,3,0,5,I'm nervous about quick votes.  @Asuka  when did you divine Victoria — was it last night or just now? Also Victoria  why are you voting Yumi so quickly? I don't want to vote without reasons. Over
1,talk,4,0,4,Rushing to vote can backfire Victoria. Let's hear more reasoning before deciding.
1,talk,5,1,1,In my opinion Ms. Yumi's reaction to Ms. Victoria's vote is crucial for insight. Let us focus on their behaviors and intent.
1,talk,6,1,3,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,7,1,2, @Victoria  you voted me quickly without any reason. Why target me specifically? That feels wolf-like—please explain.
1,talk,8,1,5,I'm still unsure...  @Asuka  when did you divine Victoria — was it last night or just now? Victoria  could you explain why you're voting Yumi so fast? Quick votes make me nervous. I do
1,talk,9,1,4,Minato let's not rush. Asuka can you clarify your divination timing for us?
1,talk,10,2,1,Let me clarify. We must scrutinize all actions closely. Sudden votes raise concerns. Mr. Minato I divined Victoria last night. I'm uncertain about Y
1,talk,11,2,3,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,12,2,2, @Victoria  you keep voting for me without saying why.
1,talk,13,2,5,Um...  @Asuka  when did you divine Victoria — was it last night or just now? Victoria  could you explain why you voted Yumi so quickly? I'm worried about voting without
1,talk,14,2,4,Victoria can you share your reasoning for targeting Yumi? It might ease tensions.
1,talk,15,3,1,Let me clarify. Since Ms. Victoria's divination confirmed her as Human. I suggest divining Mr. Minato next. Their caution could be telling.
1,talk,16,3,3,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,17,3,2,Victoria ignores all my and others’ questions and keeps voting without reasons—that’s too wolfish for me.
1,talk,18,3,5,I'm still nervous.  @Asuka  did you divine Victoria last night or just now? Also Victoria  why are you voting Yumi so quickly—any specific reason? I don't want to jump into voting w

2,talk,1,0,4,Asuka any new insights from last night's divination? We need clear guidance now.
2,talk,2,0,1,I divined Minato last night. He is Human. Let me clarify that this finding is crucial for our discussions moving forward.
2,talk,3,1,5,I'm still really sad...  @Asuka  did you divine Victoria last night or just now? Could everyone also say who voted for Victoria and why? I don't want to make another mistake. Over
2,talk,4,1,4,With Minato cleared Asuka who do you suspect next? We need a decisive plan.
2,talk,5,1,1,In my opinion. With Minato cleared. Victoria gone. And Yumi attacked. It is likely Mr. Shunichi or possibly Minato is a werewolf.
2,talk,6,2,5,I'm still really scared...  @Asuka  when did you divine Victoria — last night or just now? Could everyone please say if they voted for Victoria and why? I don't want to make another mistake
2,talk,7,2,4,Asuka your logic seems flawed. Minato let's focus on facts not fears.
2,talk,8,2,1,I find Mr. Shunichi's silence about his suspicions peculiar. Despite clearing Minato we ought to gather facts and reassess. Shunichi what is your cu
2,talk,9,3,5,I'm really sad...  @Asuka  you said Victoria was human — when did you divine her? Could everyone tell who they voted to execute Victoria and why? I'm scared of voting wrong again.
2,talk,10,3,4,Asuka I'm analyzing carefully. Minato I suggest patience while we gather clearer facts.
2,talk,11,3,1,Mr. Minato. Your concerns are valid. Let me clarify. I divined Ms. Victoria as human. In my opinion Shunichi is evasive.
