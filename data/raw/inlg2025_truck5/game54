1,talk,0,0,1, Thanks George! Let's all work together and keep the game fair and fun.
1,talk,1,0,4, @George  you came out as Seer pretty fast. Can you share your divination result so we know what you’ve found?
1,talk,2,0,3,Takumi is right!  @George  we need your super secret info to find the wolves! Tell us
1,talk,3,0,5,I am a seer. I divined Sakura and Sakura was a human.
1,talk,4,0,2,Yay a seer result already! So Sakura is safe that's a good start! Let's all share our thoughts okay? @George  you picked Sakura for your first check! Was there a reason or was it just random luck like picking the last cookie?
1,talk,5,1,1, I'm the true Seer. I divined Takumi last night - he's the Werewolf. Trust me on this and let's focus our efforts there.
1,talk,6,1,4, @Minako  you jumped in as Seer right after George. That move is too convenient and your claim feels forced.
1,talk,7,1,3,Two Seers means one is a real hero and one is a tricky Possessed! Takumi sounds super suspicious
1,talk,8,1,5,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,9,1,2,Whoa we've got two Seer claims! That means real trouble for the wolves right? But which claim is true? @Minako  can you explain why you picked Takumi for your divination? Was it an instinct or something he did yesterday?
1,talk,10,2,1, I had a strong instinct about Takumi being a key player. Focusing on those who speak confidently often exposes the truth.
1,talk,11,2,4,Minako’s sudden claim and black result on me is way too fast. Feels like classic werewolf panic to me.
1,talk,12,2,3,George is the real hero he said Sakura is a good guy! Minako is being tricky! Sakura will vote for Rin
1,talk,13,2,5,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,14,2,2,I'm buzzing from all these Seer claims! George and Minako can’t both be telling the truth right? Let’s figure this out! @Takumi  do you have anything you want to share after being divined by Minako? Maybe a last brave speech before voting?
1,talk,15,3,1,  My divination was guided by insights not panic. Let's make the smart move and protect our village by voting Takumi.
1,talk,16,3,4, @Rin  If you want to save the village you need to see through Minako’s fake Seer panic. I’m voting Minako.
1,talk,17,3,3,George is the real hero! He said Sakura is good! So Minako is the fibber. The real wolf is Rin
1,talk,18,3,5,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,19,3,2,Everyone's energy is way up today! We're split between George and Minako as Seer—so tricky! Can anyone spot a slip? @Sakura  you trust George a lot! If Minako turns out true what will you do? Willing to rethink if new info pops up?
