0,talk,0,0,4,Hi everyone! Let's work together and figure out who the werewolves might be!

0,talk,2,0,3,Hello everyone! I'm Asuka ready to unravel mysteries with all of you. Let's find those werewolves!
0,talk,3,0,2,Greetings everyone. @Asuka  @Mio  @Servas @Yumi looking forward to a bit of chaos and deduction today.
0,talk,4,0,5,Hello. I am Servas. My role is seer. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,4,Nice to meet you all! Servas any insights to share as the seer?
0,talk,6,1,1, @Servas  That's a big claim â€” please tell us your divination result now. Claiming seer without giving a result makes me nervous. Anyone else have early reads? O

0,talk,12,3,4,Let's stay calm everyone. Servas we're here to help if you need support.
0,talk,13,3,1, @Servas  Please tell us who you checked last night â€” claiming seer without a result is risky. If you won't reveal soon  we should consider voting to force it. Anyo

1,talk,0,0,3, Last night I divined Servas and the result showed that he is the Werewolf. Let's strategically align our actions for safety.
1,talk,1,0,5,I am a seer. I divined Mio and Mio was a human.
1,talk,2,0,1,I divined Yumi last night â€” sheâ€™s WEREWOLF. Servas says he checked me (says Iâ€™m human)  while Asuka says Servas is WEREWOLF â€” that canâ€™t both be true. Asu @Asuka . Over
1,talk,3,0,2,Three Seers canâ€™t all be real so letâ€™s focus on Servas and Yumi as divined wolves.  @Yumi  do you have a defense?
1,talk,4,0,4,I promise I'm not a werewolf! Maybe Asuka and Mio are trying to confuse us.
1,talk,5,1,3,As the Seer I got a clear divine result that points to Servas being a Werewolf. We need to focus on this clear evidence.
1,talk,6,1,5,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,7,1,1,I divined Yumi as WEREWOLF last night.  @Asuka  you said Servas is a werewolf â€” that directly conflicts with Servasâ€™s divination (he says Iâ€™m human) and with my result. Whoâ€™s lying here? I trust my re
1,talk,8,1,2,With three seers and conflicting wolf results someoneâ€™s lying big.  @Mio  why did you choose Yumi for your divination?
1,talk,9,1,4,I think Asuka and Mio might be working together to deceive us. Let's be cautious!
1,talk,10,2,3,I assure you of my role as the Seer. My divine result indicating Servas as a Werewolf is accurate. We need to focus on that.
1,talk,11,2,5,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,12,2,1,I divined Yumi as WEREWOLF.  @Asuka  you claimed Servas is a werewolf â€” that conflicts with Servasâ€™s statement. Please show your divination result or explain  otherwise you look suspici
1,talk,13,2,2, @Yumi  you were divined as wolf by Mio. Do you believe Asuka Servas or Mio is telling the truth about their Seer claim?
1,talk,14,2,4,Honestly Shunichi I'm confused too! I don't trust Asuka or Mio right now.
1,talk,15,3,3, I understand the confusion but my earlier claim stands. I am the true Seer. Servas being a Werewolf is my firm divination result.
1,talk,16,3,5,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,17,3,1,Iâ€™m the seer â€” I checked  @Yumi  last night and sheâ€™s WEREWOLF. We should lynch her today. Any last defenses? Over
1,talk,18,3,2,Servas feels too stubborn and defensive without evidence so Iâ€™m voting Servas. Anyone with a better theory speak up now.
1,talk,19,3,4,I'm not a werewolf I promise! Maybe it's a plan by Asuka and Mio to mislead us.
