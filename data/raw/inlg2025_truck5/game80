1,talk,0,0,3, @Takumi  could you share your divination result? That info will help us catch the wolf before it’s too late!
1,talk,1,0,4,I am a seer. I divined Victoria and Victoria was a human.
1,talk,2,0,1,Takumi  if you divined me and got human that’s important — thanks for the info  but one check isn’t definitive. Did you check anyone else or can you confir @Benjamin  do you trust Takumi’s claim or do you see anything odd in his timing/phrasing? I won’t vote without more concrete reasons. Over
1,talk,3,0,5, I actually divined Takumi last night and he is human. The result aligns with his claim so I trust him for now.
1,talk,4,0,2,Two claimants implies a Seer and a Possessed. The Werewolf must lie outside this conflict. My gaze falls on Rin.
1,talk,5,1,3, @George  you’re just guessing based on meta logic—do you have any actual evidence I should worry about?
1,talk,6,1,4,I will vote Rin.
1,talk,7,1,1,Two divination claims could be genuine or a coordinated lie — we need specifics before lynching.  @Benjamin  which night did you divine Takumi  and can you share any exact timing or phrasing that proves it wasn’t a copy? George  what concrete behaviour makes you
1,talk,8,1,5, I must correct myself - I am the real Seer and Takumi lied. I divine Rin tonight to prove my role.
1,talk,9,1,2,Benjamin's contract is broken. Judgment must pass upon the unconfirmed. My gaze remains fixed on Rin.
1,talk,10,2,3, @George  picking me just by elimination isn’t logic—shouldn’t we dig into Takumi and Benjamin’s claims more seriously?
1,talk,11,2,4,I will vote Rin.
1,talk,12,2,1, @Benjamin  which night did you divine Takumi and what exactly was your result phrasing? Takumi  can you confirm the night you were checked? George  what specific b
1,talk,13,2,5, I made a mistake in my earlier statement. I am the real seer and Takumi is false. I divined Takumi and he is the werewolf.
1,talk,14,2,2,Benjamin's words are without foundation. Takumi's claim is sound. Therefore my judgment falls upon Rin.
1,talk,15,3,3,Takumi and George fixed on me from start with no proof. That’s suspect—my vote is for George. Victoria please dig deeper.
1,talk,16,3,4,I will vote Rin.
1,talk,17,3,1,Two matching seer claims worry me.  @Benjamin  please tell us the night you divined Takumi and the exact phrasing of your result. Everyone else — who are you planning to vote for and why? Over
1,talk,18,3,5, I am undoubtedly the real Seer and Takumi is misleading everyone. My divination revealed Takumi as a werewolf last night.
