0,talk,0,0,3,Hi everyone let's stay calm and share our thoughts. Any ideas on who might be suspicious?
0,talk,1,0,1,Hey there. I'm Shunichi. Let's piece this puzzle together and catch the werewolf. Got any theories on who's acting out of line?
0,talk,2,0,2,Hello everyone! I'm Jonathan ready to find out who among us is the cunning werewolf!
0,talk,3,0,5,Nice to see everyone. Let’s stay cool-headed and focus on the little things people say and do from the start.
0,talk,4,0,4,Hello. I am George. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,5,1,3,It's still early but George claiming villager might be something to watch closely.

1,talk,0,0,1,I divined Misaki and guess what. The divination result says werewolf. Maybe we should stick to sushi and chess Misaki?
1,talk,1,0,3,That's a serious claim Shunichi. Misaki do you have a response to this accusation?
1,talk,2,0,4,I will vote Misaki.
1,talk,3,0,2, George is human based on my divination last night. Let's focus on Shunichi's claim about Misaki.
1,talk,4,0,5,Three Seers makes no sense. Shunichi’s claim feels forced. Isn’t Jonathan’s white result more reliable?
1,talk,5,1,1,Jonathan claims he's a seer. But if I Shunichi know otherwise could his white result for George be deceiving us? What do you think?
1,talk,6,1,3,This is confusing with multiple seer claims. We need more discussion to verify these roles.
1,talk,7,1,4,I will vote Misaki.
1,talk,8,1,2, As the true Seer my divination found George to be human. Shunichi's false claim about Misaki is suspicious.
1,talk,9,1,5,Three Seer claims isn’t normal. There’s likely a Madman causing confusion. Would a wolf really show up this boldly?
1,talk,10,2,1,Jonathan claims he's seer but I'm sunlight. Should we trust his motives Misaki? Let's discuss the three Seer claims.
1,talk,11,2,3,With three seer claims we need to be cautious. Let's focus on actions and consistency.
1,talk,12,2,4,I will vote Misaki.
1,talk,13,2,2, As the real Seer I insist Shunichi is the wolf here. My readings are precise. Ignore his distractions and trust in my clarity.
1,talk,14,2,5,Three Seer claims mean someone’s lying. I trust Jonathan more since his results match the way he’s reasoning.
1,talk,15,3,1,Misaki warns with such ferocity you'd think she's leading a wolf pack. Let's not brush off my trusty divination shall we?
1,talk,16,3,3,It's tough to decide but Jonathan's reasoning seems more consistent so far. Let's be careful.
1,talk,17,3,4,I will vote Misaki.
1,talk,18,3,2, Stick to the facts. My divination revealed George as human which aligns with his claim. We must question Shunichi's deceptive tactics.
1,talk,19,3,5,Jonathan’s divination fits the facts; Shunichi seems desperate to frame me. I’m voting Shunichi—let’s stop the real wolf now.
