0,talk,0,0,5,Greetings everyone—it’s Benjamin here. May the sharpest mind and keenest eye prevail in this game of shadows.
0,talk,1,0,3,Hello everyone! I am Misaki. Perhaps today will be fun and engaging. Let's unveil the truth. Working together is key!
0,talk,2,0,1,Hi hi! It's Sakura~ Let's chat — who do you think is suspicious today?  @Benjamin  you sounded confident just now  who are you eyeing? I'm a bit nervous but excited! Over
0,talk,3,0,2,My name is Servas. I am but a humble villager intent on seeking the truth with patience and open ears. @Sakura  take heart—nerves are natural at dawn. Let us proceed slowly and share openly for trust breeds clarity.
0,talk,4,0,4,Hello. I am Victoria. My role is seer. Have a good game.

0,talk,10,2,1,Um...  @Benjamin  you were really quiet—do you have any guesses who’s suspicious? Please say something  I’m nervous! Over
0,talk,11,3,1,I'm still worried and a bit nervous. Can everyone say one person they suspect and one they trust?  @Benjamin  please share even a little thought — it might help! Over

1,talk,0,0,4,I am a seer. I divined Servas and Servas was a human.
1,talk,1,0,3,I see. Victoria's claim is quite significant. If Servas is human. Perhaps Benjamin's confidence could be a part of his strategy. Any thoughts?
1,talk,2,0,5,Victoria can’t be the wolf so logic points at Sakura Misaki or Servas.  @Sakura  who do you think is suspicious now?
1,talk,3,0,1,Eek  I’m flustered... Victoria saying Servas is human makes me trust that a bit  so I’m more worried about someone who quickly rules out Victoria.  @Benjamin  why do you think I’m suspicious? Tell us your reasons  please. Over
1,talk,4,0,2,Let us not rush to judgment. I urge all to share calmly. Trust comes from conversation not mere suspicion or haste. @Victoria  could you gently explain your reasoning for choosing me as your first divination? Clarity serves us all.
1,talk,5,1,4,I will vote Sakura.
1,talk,6,1,3,Victoria-san already declared Servas human. Perhaps Benjamin-san should be next? Victoria-san your choice seemed strategic.
1,talk,7,1,5,Victoria’s seer CO doesn’t match my own result I suspect she’s possessed so the real wolf is among Sakura Misaki Servas
1,talk,8,1,1,Eek! I’m not the wolf—Victoria said Servas is human  so why vote me?  @Victoria  please explain why you picked Servas to check and how sure you are. Can everyone share a quick thought after? Over
1,talk,9,1,2,Victoria thanks for clearing my name. I trust your intent but clarity in your methods gives us all peace of mind. @Benjamin  you doubt Victoria's seer claim. Could you share your process? Let's seek wisdom together.
1,talk,10,2,4,Over
1,talk,11,2,3,I see if Benjamin-san is suspicious of Victoria-san it might be beneficial to divine him next. Perhaps others have thoughts?
1,talk,12,2,5,Victoria’s CO should be treated carefully Possessed often claims seer focus on Sakura Misaki Servas for today’s vote.
1,talk,13,2,1,Nooo  I’m not a wolf!  @Victoria  please explain again — why did you check Servas and why did you vote for me? I’m really scared. Can someone else share a quick thought? Over
1,talk,14,2,2,With Victoria's claim and result let's check for consistency. Let's reflect on each person's logic with open minds and steady hearts. @Benjamin  you doubt Victoria and look elsewhere. What guides your suspicion most today? Please enlighten us.
1,talk,15,3,3,Victoria-san rushing to vote could be a wolf tactic to misguide everyone. I see. Her assurance from one divination seems weak. @Servas Benjamin-san questions Victoria-san's seer claim. Do her actions seem wolf-like to you too? Her voting was unusually swift perhaps.
1,talk,16,3,5,Victoria’s claim doesn’t match reality and she’s not the wolf—so I’ll vote Servas as most likely werewolf.
1,talk,17,3,1,I'm not a wolf!  @Victoria  please explain again — why did you check Servas and why are you voting me? I'm scared; can someone give a short reason who they trust or suspect? Over
1,talk,18,3,2,Benjamin your insistence stands out. What's in Victoria's play that makes you so sure? Let's judge ideas wisely. @Misaki  your caution has merit. Victoria's quick vote and open claim both stand out. What worries you most?

2,talk,0,0,3,Victoria-san's decision feels like it makes Benjamin-san's move quite bold. We should perhaps consider Sakura-san's worries. Thoughts?
2,talk,1,0,5, Victoria human Sakura human. That leaves Misaki as the only logical wolf. I’m voting Misaki.
2,talk,2,0,1,Oh no... it's just us now.  @Misaki  are you really the seer? Please tell me — I can't vote without knowing. I'm so scared. Over
2,talk,3,1,3,Benjamin-san. You mentioned I'm the logical wolf but with Victoria as the seer I'm indeed a villager. Let's reconsider this. Sakura-san I sense your
2,talk,4,1,5, @Sakura  I am the seer. I divined Victoria and you—both human. Misaki is the only gray. Let’s vote Misaki and win.
2,talk,5,1,1, @Misaki  are you really the seer? Please tell me who you checked and the result — I promise I'm a villager. If you're human I'll follow your vote. I'm so scared. Ov
2,talk,6,2,3,Sakura-san Benjamin's dual claim seems puzzling. If unsure weigh actions carefully. Victoria-san declared seer first then was attacked. Logic?
2,talk,7,2,5, Victoria human Sakura human. Misaki is the only possibility for werewolf. Let’s vote.
2,talk,8,2,1, @Misaki  please tell me exactly who you checked and what the result was — name and human/werewolf — so I can decide. I'm really scared  please help. Over
2,talk,9,3,3,I see. Let's think about Sakura's behavior. Her claim seems weak and inconsistent. If Sakura were a true villager she'd have more conviction. @Benjamin Benjamin-san. I see your claim of being the seer seems unconvincing. Sakura-san's patterns are worrying. Perhaps something is amiss?
2,talk,10,3,5,Victoria bite outed—she was human. My divinations showed Sakura and Victoria are human. Only Misaki can be wolf.
2,talk,11,3,1, @Misaki  please tell me who you checked and the result — name and human/werewolf. If you're human I'll follow your vote. I'm so scared  please help! Over
