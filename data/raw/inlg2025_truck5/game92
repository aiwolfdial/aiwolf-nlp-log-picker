0,talk,0,0,5,Well let’s see who’s actually awake and thinking today I hope you’re ready @George @Jonathan  @Misaki  @Yumi
0,talk,1,0,3,Hello. I am Yumi. My role is villager. Have a good game.
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello everyone. I am Misaki. I look forward to joining you in this game. Let us uncover the identity of the werewolf together.
0,talk,3,0,4,Good morning everyone. Let's work together and have a good game. I'm ready to get started.

0,talk,8,1,4,It seems everyone is here. Let's focus on finding the werewolf among us today.
0,talk,9,1,2,I am Jonathan. I enjoy quiet observation and reading. This world is a fascinating new book.
0,talk,10,2,4,Jonathan it's good to have a keen observer on our side. Let's keep our eyes open.

0,talk,12,3,4,Misaki you've been quiet. Any thoughts on how we should proceed?

1,talk,0,0,1,Everyone seems eager. Shall we share our suspicions first? It's a good place to start I believe.
1,talk,1,0,2,The one who can peer into another's heart should speak first. Their knowledge is our most vital data.
1,talk,2,0,3,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,3,0,4,Interesting choice Yumi. Jonathan do you have anything to say about this vote?
1,talk,4,0,5, Misaki is Human. Anyone pushing a Misaki vote is suspect. Focus elsewhere for today’s vote.
1,talk,5,1,1,Shunichi's logic seems sound suggesting Jonathan may lack trustworthiness. Hmm.  @Shunichi  thank you for your support. Thoughts on his Seer move?
1,talk,6,1,2,Shunichi shared a vision. Misaki is human. The wolf and its shadow are among George and Yumi.
1,talk,7,1,3,Over
1,talk,8,1,4,Shunichi your claim is bold. I’d like to hear why you cleared Misaki as human.
1,talk,9,1,5,Misaki is confirmed human by my vision so our wolf is among George Jonathan and Yumi. I propose we vote within that group.
1,talk,10,2,1,Tanaka. I noticed Yumi chose Jonathan quite hastily... It's something to ponder. Who do you believe should be our choice today?
1,talk,11,2,2,Yumi's vote on me had no logical basis. This makes her the most dissonant data point. I will vote for Yumi.
1,talk,12,2,4,Jonathan's vote for Yumi is understandable. Still let's carefully weigh our options.
1,talk,13,2,5,Given Yumi’s wild vote and no evidence her play feels wolf. Unless convincing logic comes up I’ll vote Yumi.
1,talk,14,3,1,Shunichi made compelling points. Tanaka. Why choose Jonathan so quickly? Share more behind your decision. It may unravel things.
1,talk,15,3,2,I agree with Shunichi. An unsubstantiated claim is the seed of deception. My vote remains on Yumi.
1,talk,16,3,4,Yumi your reasoning could clarify this situation. Please share your thoughts on Jonathan.
1,talk,17,3,5,Yumi’s rash vote stands out but George’s silence worries me too. I’m voting Yumi today—if wrong George needs more scrutiny.
