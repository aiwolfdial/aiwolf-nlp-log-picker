1,talk,0,0,1,I’ll be honest—I’m also the Seer. I checked  @Daisuke  and he was white. I want everyone to think calmly before voting.
1,talk,1,0,3,Dear ones. Having both seers divine  @Yumi  tonight seems wise. Clarity for tomorrow is always a comfort wouldn't you agree?
1,talk,2,0,4, Midori if we have two seers what do you make of Mio's claim? Shouldn't we clarify this issue first?
1,talk,3,0,5,Aw geez two Seers? This is some of my trademark bad luck for sure! What do we do?
1,talk,4,0,2,Alright I'll go first—I'm the Seer and last night I checked Daisuke. He was Human! Let's share thoughts openly! @Midori  curious what made you decide to claim Seer too? Feels like a big coincidence huh!
1,talk,5,1,1,Having two Seers means one of us is lying. If we both check  @Yumi  maybe it narrows things down.
1,talk,6,1,3, @Yumi  My dear Yumi. Between Mio and Midori. Whom do you find holds the truth? Your insight could guide us warmly.
1,talk,7,1,4, My fellow friends let's focus. I divined Mio as a Werewolf. Trust in my words we must unite and vote for Mio today.
1,talk,8,1,5,Whoa three Seers! This is wild! We have to vote for one of them today right? It's our only clue
1,talk,9,1,2,Whew what a twist! Three Seers? Okay everyone let's stay chill and look for slip-ups! Who feels fishy to you all? @Daisuke  you say you "divined" me as Wolf but you didn't claim Seer until now! Why hide it at first? That's odd!
1,talk,10,2,1,It’s odd Daisuke only claimed Seer after Mio’s result. Feels like reacting not leading. Shouldn’t we question that?
1,talk,11,2,3,Dears with Daisuke's claim arriving late it does sow seeds of doubt. Wouldn't following Midori or Mio lead to clarity now?
1,talk,12,2,4, It's crucial to discern the truth clearly—my late claim was strategic to observe reactions. Stand by my divination—Mio is the Werewolf.
1,talk,13,2,5,Yeah Midori and Shizue are right! Daisuke's late claim is super suspicious! My vote goes there
1,talk,14,2,2,Okay with three Seer claims things are more tangled than a bowl of spaghetti! Let's untangle carefully team! @Shizue  your calm is like a warm cup of tea! Who feels more trustworthy to you—Midori or Daisuke? Just curious!
1,talk,15,3,1, @Daisuke ’s late CO feels forced—I vote Daisuke today but Mio shouldn’t be trusted blindly. Let’s keep eyes open.
1,talk,16,3,3,Good friends. Midori's insight brings clarity. For tomorrow's chat.  @Mio  My dear. Like sweet tea calming a storm. Do you agree?
1,talk,17,3,4, Trust cannot be gauged by timing but truth. I stand by my claim: Mio is the Werewolf. Let reason prevail not doubt.
1,talk,18,3,5,Over
1,talk,19,3,2,Three Seers is so wild! Everyone's ideas today spark my curiosity. Let's really listen close and ask questions okay? @Shizue  you have such a gentle vibe! Between Daisuke and Midori whose Seer claim feels real? I want your honest take!

2,talk,0,0,1, @Yumi  Let’s not assume Mio’s first claim makes her real—clever wolves know that’s what we expect.
2,talk,1,0,2,Okay! I checked Midori last night—Midori is Human! Wild but true and yeah I'm THE real Seer! Happy to answer questions. @Yumi  how do you feel about Midori's push on me? I know I'm clear but that feels odd right?
2,talk,2,0,5,Whoops! Looks like this adventurer is one of the bad guys! I'm the werewolf! We win
2,talk,3,1,1, @Yumi  are you really the Werewolf or just joking? A true wolf rarely reveals so let’s think before voting.
2,talk,4,1,2,Whoa plot twist! Did Yumi really just claim Werewolf out of the blue? That's gutsy! How's everyone feeling now? @Midori  you say clever wolves claim early but I went first because I'm truly the Seer! Why double-doubt me?
2,talk,5,1,5,No joke I'm the wolf! Let's vote Midori and wrap this adventure up
2,talk,6,2,1,Yumi your open wolf claim feels risky—are you serious or just trying to mislead us? Let’s not rush our vote yet.
2,talk,7,2,2,Yumi's claim is wild! If she's really the wolf that's a twisty ending—should we take her at her word or be cautious? @Midori  you’re super careful today! If Yumi’s confession is real what reason could she have to fake it at this point?
2,talk,8,2,5,It's not a trick I promise! Bad luck for you Midori! My vote's on you
2,talk,9,3,1, @Mio  your results always benefit you so I’ll vote for Mio today since Yumi’s claim might be a risky bluff
2,talk,10,3,2,Yumi just open-wolfed so I'm seriously leaning toward voting her! That was so bold even for this game! @Midori  I get your caution but Yumi's claim is way too confident to be a bluff don't you think?
2,talk,11,3,5, @Mio  it's our win! Let's wrap this up! I'm voting for Midori for sure
