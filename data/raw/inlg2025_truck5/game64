0,talk,2,0,3,I'm Jonathan Seer. I will claim now as there is no BG. Any CC today? I'll reveal D1 result and check outside claimers. @Benjamin  noted on VT claim. Please share one lean and one suspect before votes. Keep it clear.
0,talk,3,0,1,Lean: trust Jonathan's seer claim for now. Suspect:  @Benjamin  — immediate villager claim with no reasoning and a push to be passive fits suspect behavior. Jonathan  reveal D1 result to validate. Over

1,talk,0,0,2,Ara? How amusing. I am the Seer. My reading revealed Ryuji is the little beast we hunt.
1,talk,1,0,5,Jonathan is the Werewolf. We need to act on this information. Let's strategize for the greater good and safeguard the village.
1,talk,2,0,1, @May  Provide the exact details of your divination: when (D1 or night)  method  and any possible interference. Jonathan earlier claimed seer; two seer clai
1,talk,3,0,4,I will vote Kenji.
1,talk,4,0,3,I am the Seer. Benjamin is Human. With May's counter wolf is in May or Kenji. Keep wagons there. Tonight I'll check Ryuji. @May  please give timing and reason for your Ryuji check. I claimed first yesterday; why counter today?
1,talk,5,1,2,Two claiming seer means a real one and a fraud. My reading found our wolf. What is Jonathan's excuse?
1,talk,6,1,5,Jonathan's claim as Seer is a deception. I am the true Seer and my divination clearly exposed Jonathan as the Werewolf.
1,talk,7,1,1,May and Kenji both claim seer — each must state exact divination: target  day/night  and timing. Jonathan already declared Benjamin Human; if Jonatha @Benjamin . Over
1,talk,8,1,4,Over
1,talk,9,1,3,Two late counterclaims. Wolf or Possessed is in May/Kenji. Keep wagons there. I’ll check Ryuji tonight. Stay steady. @Kenji  give N0 target timing and motive. Why no D0 counter to my early claim? Clarity now please.
1,talk,10,2,2,Kenji fingers Jonathan and I found our beast. Jonathan's tale is useless. Let's hang the least helpful 'seer'.
1,talk,11,2,5, Trust is earned by truth. My divination revealed Jonathan is the Werewolf. Let's focus on protecting our village!
1,talk,12,2,1,Three seer claims (Jonathan  May  Kenji). Each must state: target  day/night  exact timing  and any possible interference. Jonathan already declared B @Benjamin . Over
1,talk,13,2,3,Discipline: wagons are May or Kenji only. Both state N0 target timing and reason. Absent that I lean Kenji today. @Benjamin Ben please build concise cases: Ryuji-wolf and Kenji-wolf. Which is stronger and why? Keep your evidence clear.
1,talk,14,3,2,How quaint  @Benjamin . Is a safe human more useful than a cornered beast? Do think carefully now.
1,talk,15,3,5, My stance is clear: Jonathan as Werewolf. Let's not dance around with doubts. The true Seer speaks the truth.
1,talk,16,3,1,All three seer claims must state: target  day/night  exact timing  and any possible interference. Jonathan claimed  @Benjamin  Human—state method and when. May and Kenji provide full divination details now. I will vote @Benjamin. Over
1,talk,17,3,3,Voting Kenji. Late counter no N0 details and tunneling. Keep wagons May/Kenji. Tonight I will check Ryuji. Stay steady. @Kenji State N0 target timing and reason or withdraw. Why no D0 counter? Calm clarity please.
