0,talk,0,0,5,I am Benjamin. Let us proceed.
0,talk,1,0,4,Ryuji. I'll claim Seer. No results yet but I'll share tomorrow. Please introduce yourselves. @Benjamin  do you have anything to add about your role or initial thoughts?
0,talk,2,0,1,I'm Shion. Villager here. Ryuji if you're really the Seer we'll need your insights.
0,talk,3,0,2,Hello everyone! I'm Rin! Oh wow! I'm just a regular villager! Guess what? Ryuji's claim is interesting! We must watch out for counterclaims! Over!

1,talk,0,0,4,Last night I divined Rin: Villager. No other Seer counterclaim so I'll keep reporting my results plainly. @Shion  you were attentive yesterday. Anything specific make you trust or doubt my Seer claim so far?
1,talk,1,0,1,Ryuji no counterclaims help your case but I'll keep observing for inconsistencies.
1,talk,2,0,2,Oh wow! Ryuji's claim of me being a villager is quite something. Is it a sneaky werewolf trick for trust? I'll keep my eyes open! Guess what?  @Shunichi  Ryuji said he divined me as a villager! Does that make him seem reliable or are you thinking of other things?
1,talk,3,0,5,I am the true Seer. My investigation of Shunichi concluded he is the Werewolf. Execute him.
1,talk,4,0,3,Ryuji is the Werewolf. I divined him. Be cautious of false claims from others trying to protect him or confuse the group.
1,talk,5,1,4,Benjamin and Shunichi counterclaiming as Seer complicates things. Only one can be telling the truth if they see each other as wolf. @Benjamin  your Seer claim is sudden. Why wait until now to counterclaim? Explain your reason for delaying.
1,talk,6,1,1,Three Seer claims are confusing. We need to decide who's most likely telling the truth.
1,talk,7,1,2, @Benjamin  Oh wow! I'm a bit like curious about your Seer claim! Why wait for Mr. Shunichi's to open up first? Sounds fishy!
1,talk,8,1,5,3 Seers means Seer Possessed and Wolf. I found the Wolf Shunichi. Therefore Ryuji is Possessed. Vote Shunichi.
1,talk,9,1,3, I apologize for misleading you earlier. I'm not the Seer. My initial claim was meant to draw out the Werewolf's allies. Given Benjamin's assertive an
1,talk,10,2,4,Shunichi's sudden switch is questionable. If Benjamin is believed I'm Possessed. But my result stands: Rin is Villager. @Shion With three conflicting Seer claims what criteria do you suggest we use to decide who is real Shion?
1,talk,11,2,1,Let's focus on consistency and logic in claims. Sudden changes can signal deceit.
1,talk,12,2,2,Oh wow! So many Seers with only one true! We gotta stop the wolf! Did you hear that Mr. Benjamin and Ryuji divined claims? Thoughts?
1,talk,13,2,5,The logical conclusion is fixed. My vote is for Shunichi. There is no other rational option.
1,talk,14,2,3,Vote for Ryuji today. My earlier claim as Seer was indeed false; however I find inconsistencies in Ryuji's behavior and claims more troubling.
1,talk,15,3,4,Assessing claims: Benjamin insists Shunichi is Wolf Shunichi recants and calls me suspicious. I maintain Rin is Villager. @Rin Despite Benjamin's strong push I see no evidence you're lying about your Villager claim from my perspective.
1,talk,16,3,1,I'll listen closely to everyone's arguments. It's crucial we choose wisely today.
1,talk,17,3,2,Oh wow! Three Seer claims! Only one can be true. Guess what? Based on logic maybe Mr. Benjamin's onto something?  @Shion  Did you think Sir Shunichi's changes are suspicious? Or is it just Mr. Benjamin's claims battling theirs?
