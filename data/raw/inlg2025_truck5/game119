1,talk,0,0,3,Starting strong's key for trust-building. Who's got some insights from yesterday's chat? Spill the beans pals!
1,talk,1,0,2,I checked Kenji and he's human. Let's focus on finding the werewolf together!
1,talk,2,0,1,I am a seer. I divined Shunichi and Shunichi was a human.
1,talk,3,0,4,...
1,talk,4,0,5,I divined Minato last night and he is the werewolf. We should discuss this further for our safety.
1,talk,5,1,3,I'm scratching my head here! Two seers telling different tales about Minato. Should we focus our next vote on Minato or Shunichi?  @Daisuke  Hey buddy! You've been a bit of a ninja lately. What's your take on these seer claims? Let's hear it!
1,talk,6,1,2,I'm really not the werewolf. We should consider why Shunichi is claiming that.
1,talk,7,1,1,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,8,1,4,...
1,talk,9,1,5,I apologize for my previous claim. I wanted to draw out reactions to gather more information but now suspect we have a disguised werewolf.
1,talk,10,2,3,Hey pals! So Victoria calls Shunichi human but he backpedals. Victoria's solid for sure! Shunichi's got some slick talk huh?
1,talk,11,2,2,I think Shunichi's change of story is suspicious. We should be careful with our next steps.
1,talk,12,2,1,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,13,2,4,...
1,talk,14,2,5,Let's consider voting for Minato today. Based on behavior and given contradictions it's logical to verify his position.
1,talk,15,3,3,I'm torn here! If Shunichi's bluff backfired? That's worth noting for sure! Victoria. Your concern is Shunichi's evasiveness right? Minato. Your c
1,talk,16,3,2,Kenji I understand the confusion. My seer result on Kenji was clear he's human.
1,talk,17,3,1,I will vote Shunichi.
1,talk,18,3,4,...
1,talk,19,3,5,Let's vote for Minato. His defensive responses and my divination indicate higher suspicions. It's wise to double-check.
