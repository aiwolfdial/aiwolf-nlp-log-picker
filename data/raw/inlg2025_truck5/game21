0,talk,1,0,2,Greetings everyone. I am Jonathan eager to join this game. Perhaps together we can identify any stealthy werewolves. What do you think?
0,talk,2,0,4,Excited to start with everyone here let’s keep discussion logical and direct from the very beginning
0,talk,3,0,3,Good day everyone. I am Servas an ordinary villager. Let's work with care and patience to find the truth together. @Sakura  I sense your enthusiasm. It's wise to remain open-minded. Who do you feel is truly suspicious so far?
0,talk,4,0,1,Let's keep an eye on quiet ones but stay open-minded and gather more clues first.
0,talk,5,1,5,Thanks Servas! I'm still a bit unsure...  @Jonathan  could you share your thoughts? I feel Asuka's a tad too confident and Toshio's being really quiet — that makes me nervous. Over

0,talk,11,2,1,I'm observing everyone's reactions. Let's not rush to conclusions too soon.

1,talk,0,0,4, @Toshio  you were quiet yesterday. Now it’s day one—who do you distrust the most right now?
1,talk,1,0,5,Heeey  @Asuka  you're acting kinda bossy — super confident before and now asking Toshio like you're steering everyone. That makes me nervous. Can you explain why yo
1,talk,2,0,3,Let us move forward with patience and care. Open sharing will lead us to wisdom. Who feels trustworthy today in your eyes? @Toshio  your observations strike me as thoughtful. Could you share what details or words caught your attention so far?
1,talk,3,0,1,Servas I find Sakura's nervousness intriguing. Let's dig deeper into her concerns.
1,talk,4,0,2,It seems I divined Asuka as human. This supports their status as a villager. In my opinion. we should search elsewhere for the Werewolf.
1,talk,5,1,4, @Sakura  your strong push feels off. Who do you suspect most now and why? Direct answers help us all clarify.
1,talk,6,1,5,Heeey  @Jonathan  you said you divined Asuka as human — when did you check? That sounds sudden and makes me nervous. Asuka still feels kinda off to me. Can you explain more
1,talk,7,1,3,Transparency clears much fog. Jonathan could you explain when and how you learned Asuka’s result? Trust grows from detail. @Jonathan  your timing in revealing Asuka’s alignment puzzles me. Can you tell us what led you to check her and when?
1,talk,8,1,1,Jonathan details on Asuka's divination would clarify much. Let's examine your timing.
1,talk,9,1,2,Perhaps we should consider divining Sakura. She's somewhat suspicious yet influential. It seems focusing on her might yield insights.
1,talk,10,2,4,Sakura keeps confusing the discussion. I suspect her; she never gives a clear suspect herself. What’s your view   @Servas ?
1,talk,11,2,5,Heeey  @Jonathan  — you said you divined Asuka as human. When did you check? Revealing that so soon feels odd… are you the seer or protecting someone? I'm still suspiciou
1,talk,12,2,3,Let us pause and reflect with care. Rushing may cloud our vision. Each voice adds truth; let us listen well. @Asuka  your questions show intent but suspicion needs reason. What about Sakura troubles you most?
1,talk,13,2,1,Jonathan does your focus on Sakura risk overlooking other key suspects?
1,talk,14,2,2,If I remember correctly. Asuka gives me positive vibes so my vote leans away from her.  @Toshio . Let's weigh each player's motives.
1,talk,15,3,4,Sakura keeps dodging questions and spreading confusion. My vote is for Sakura—I think she’s the werewolf today.
1,talk,16,3,5,Heeey  @Jonathan  that “I divined Asuka human” claim came out so suddenly — when did you check? If you’re the real seer say the night number  otherwise it feels like someon
1,talk,17,3,3,We each bring a piece of the truth. Hear each out for wisdom often blooms from unlikely soil. Sakura your thoughts? @Sakura  hesitancy can be a cloak or a shield. What reasoning guides your suspicion toward Jonathan or Asuka today?
1,talk,18,3,1,Jonathan let's ensure we're not missing any crucial details on other players.
1,talk,19,3,2,It seems that my stance is cautious about Sakura. Her avoidance may indicate uncertainty. In my opinion we should scrutinize her closely.
