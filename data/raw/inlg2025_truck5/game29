1,talk,0,0,4,Ah. Young miss. Benjamin's mind is like a garden in winter. Dormant. Yet beneath. Plans may quietly bloom when least expected.
1,talk,1,0,5,I will vote Takumi.
1,talk,2,0,1,I divined Misaki last night and she is a Werewolf. Let's focus our efforts on proving it and voting accordingly.
1,talk,3,0,2,It appears we wake to revelations. Since we have a Seer claim I suppose clarity is forced upon us. @Takumi  your conviction is admirable. But would a true Seer reveal so soon or play to impatience?
1,talk,4,0,3,I divined Benjamin last night — HUMAN.  @Takumi  you claim you divined me as Werewolf  which directly contradicts my result and is very suspicious. Explain your timing and target now or you're likely
1,talk,5,1,4,Seems we've two Seer claims. If Misaki suspects Benjamin. Clarity may bloom through united divinations.  @George  My friend. Seers may shed light on you. How do you wish to see this game unfold?

1,talk,7,1,1, I need to confess that my earlier claim of being a Seer was not true. I made that claim to try to gather more information and force real claims or actions f
1,talk,8,1,2,Well we certainly have a glut of Seers this morning. One suspects clairvoyance is contagious or perhaps just fashionable. @Misaki Your swift Seer claim intrigues me Misaki. Do you fear Takumi's approach revealed too much or too little?
1,talk,9,1,3, @Benjamin  I divined you HUMAN last night. Takumi admitted his Seer claim was a lie and it directly contradicted my result—classic wolf tactic to sow confusion.
1,talk,10,2,4,Misaki seems genuine. My friend let us turn the mystical gaze upon those wavering. Could Takumi's tales need deeper roots Benjamin?
1,talk,11,2,1,Vote Misaki. Her immediate claim of being Seer after my push causes doubt. Seers wait to gather info usually; her haste raises suspicions.
1,talk,12,2,2,Takumi’s confession is rapid and bold. Misaki your confidence is comforting—maybe too comforting for this tense game. @Servas  your poetry offers reprieve. Do you see Misaki’s calm as wisdom or a front for something else?
1,talk,13,2,3,Takumi admitted he lied about being a Seer and contradicted my divination—I'm voting  @Takumi . Anyone else? Speak now so we can vote. Over
1,talk,14,3,4, @George  George. In this tapestry of revelations my friend can you see the threads that bind Misaki's foresight to truth's embrace?
1,talk,15,3,1,Despite my earlier fabrication Misaki’s rushed Seer claim right after hints at manipulation. Her certainty feels staged—a tactic to deflect atten
1,talk,16,3,2,Wisdom isn't always with the loudest; sometimes it's those acting too swiftly or smoothly we should watch. @Takumi  your questioning of Misaki's timing is noted but your persistence keeps the fog thick. Curious indeed.
1,talk,17,3,3,I've cast my vote for  @Takumi  — he admitted lying about being a Seer and contradicted my divination. We should eliminate him. Any objections or extra info? Over
